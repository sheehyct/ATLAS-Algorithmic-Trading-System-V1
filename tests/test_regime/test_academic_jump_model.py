Unit Tests for Academic Statistical Jump Model - Phase B Optimization

Tests the optimization solver functions (coordinate descent + dynamic programming)
to ensure they match the academic paper specifications (Shu et al., Princeton, 2024).

Test Coverage:
    1. Dynamic programming algorithm correctness
    2. Coordinate descent convergence
    3. Multi-start consistency
    4. Model fitting on real SPY data
    5. Online inference and March 2020 crash detection
    6. Lambda sensitivity analysis

Professional Standards:
    - NO lookahead bias (parameters from paper, not optimized on returns)
    - Test on real Alpaca data (production consistency)
    - NO unicode characters (Windows compatibility)
