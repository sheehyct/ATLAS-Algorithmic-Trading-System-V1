Regime-Based Capital Allocation

Manages capital allocation across strategies based on detected market regime.

Allocation Framework:
    TREND_BULL: 90% deployed (heavy momentum, moderate mean reversion)
    TREND_NEUTRAL: 70% deployed (quality-momentum, mean reversion focus)
    TREND_BEAR: 20-40% deployed (quality-momentum only, tiered protection)
    CRASH: 10% deployed (quality-momentum minimal, 90% cash)

Bear Market Protection Tiers:
    Conservative: 80% cash, 20% quality-momentum
    Moderate: 65% cash, 15% low-vol ETF, 20% quality
    Aggressive: 60% cash, 10% low-vol, 15% managed futures, 15% quality

Implementation Status: Placeholder - to be implemented in Phase 1.4
