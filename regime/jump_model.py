Jump Model Regime Detection

Implementation of Jump Model for market regime classification.

Academic Foundation:
    - Simpler than GMM/HMM approaches (3 parameters vs 6-7)
    - Lower turnover (44% annually vs 141% for GMM)
    - More robust to overfitting
    - Real-time classification capability

Regime Classification:
    TREND_BULL: Jump probability >70%, positive return direction
    TREND_BEAR: Jump probability >70%, negative return direction
    TREND_NEUTRAL: Jump probability 30-70%
    CRASH: Jump probability >90% or special crash indicators

Implementation Status: Placeholder - to be implemented in Phase 1.3
