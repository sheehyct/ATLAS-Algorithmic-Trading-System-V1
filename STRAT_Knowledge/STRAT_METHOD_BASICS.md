INTRODUCTION & CORE PHILOSOPHY

The STRAT trading system, developed by Rob Smith, is a pure price-action methodology built on three possibilities for each candle. It seeks to eliminate subjectivity, add structure, clarify entries and exits, and anchor all decisions around price and timeframe alignment.

Core Principles:

Price action only—no indicators

Three basic bar scenarios define all price action

Timeframe alignment is critical for high probability trades

Targets and stops are based on price structure, not indicators

Risk management underpins every setup

Key Advantages:

Trade any asset, any time frame

Remove emotion from decisions

Clear, repeatable entry/exit signals

Consistent risk/reward structure

THE THREE UNIVERSAL TRUTHS

Universal Truth #1: Three Scenarios Only

Scenario 1 (Inside Bar): Price is contained within the prior candle’s high/low.

Scenario 2 (Directional Bar): Price breaks either the high or the low of the prior candle, but not both.

Scenario 3 (Outside Bar): Price breaks both the previous candle’s high and low.

Universal Truth #2: Timeframe Continuity
Align multiple timeframes in the same direction using directional bars (2s) for maximum probability.

Universal Truth #3: Broadening Formations
Price discovery naturally creates higher highs and lower lows. These broadening formations establish natural targets.

CANDLESTICK SCENARIOS (1-2-3 SYSTEM)

Scenario 1 – Inside Bar

High is lower than previous high and low is higher than previous low. Indicates a pause or equilibrium—anticipate a breakout.
Scenario 2 – Directional Bar

2U (two-up): Breaks previous high

2D (two-down): Breaks previous low
Scenario 3 – Outside Bar

Breaks both prior high and low. Represents major volatility or reversal; forms the basis for broadening patterns.

STRAT PATTERN RECOGNITION

Primary Reversal Patterns

2-1-2 Reversal

Bullish: 2D ➔ 1 ➔ 2U. Entry: break of inside high + $0.01; stop: inside bar low; target: previous high

Bearish: 2U ➔ 1 ➔ 2D. Entry: break of inside low – $0.01; stop: inside bar high; target: previous low

3-1-2 Reversal

Bullish: 3 ➔ 1 ➔ 2U. Entry: inside bar high + $0.01; stop: inside bar low; target: 3-bar high

Bearish: 3 ➔ 1 ➔ 2D. Entry: inside bar low – $0.01; stop: inside bar high; target: 3-bar low

2-2 Reversal
Structure: Two consecutive directional bars in opposite directions

Bullish: 2D ➔ 2U. Entry: high of 2U bar + $0.01; stop: low of 2U bar; target: next resistance or prior high

Bearish: 2U ➔ 2D. Entry: low of 2D bar – $0.01; stop: high of 2D bar; target: next support or prior low

Continuation Patterns

2-2 Continuation: Two bars in same direction; entry after second bar confirmation.

Inside Bar Continuation: Series of inside bars then breakout; enter on break.

REV STRAT PATTERNS (FAILED BREAKOUT REVERSALS)

Rev Strats capture failed breakouts that reverse hard. Although called “2-bar rev strats,” they are always 4-bar sequences.

Rev Strat Structure and Definition

Basic Structure: X-1-2-2 (where X is typically a scenario 2 or scenario 3)

Bar 1: Scenario 2 (2U or 2D) or scenario 3 (outside bar)

Bar 2: Inside bar (1)

Bar 3: Directional break (2U or 2D)—fails to reach target

Bar 4: Opposite reversal bar (2D or 2U)—the entry candle

Key Concept: The 3rd bar tries to break out but fails to meet its STRAT target, signaling a likely reversal as market participants are trapped.

Rev Strat Pattern Types

3-1-2U-2D Rev Strat (Bearish)

Sequence: 3 ➔ 1 ➔ 2U (fails) ➔ 2D (entry)

Entry: 2D reversal bar forms

Target: Low of 1st (3) bar

Stop: High of reversal bar

3-1-2D-2U Rev Strat (Bullish)

Sequence: 3 ➔ 1 ➔ 2D (fails) ➔ 2U (entry)

Entry: 2U reversal bar forms

Target: High of 1st (3) bar

Stop: Low of reversal bar

2-1-2U-2D Rev Strat (Bearish)

Sequence: 2U/2D ➔ 1 ➔ 2U (fails) ➔ 2D (entry)

Entry: 2D reversal bar forms

Target: Low of 1st bar

Stop: High of reversal bar

2-1-2D-2U Rev Strat (Bullish)

Sequence: 2U/2D ➔ 1 ➔ 2D (fails) ➔ 2U (entry)

Entry: 2U reversal bar forms

Target: High of 1st bar

Stop: Low of reversal bar

Why Rev Strats Matter

Scenario 3 Rev Strats are especially significant as they follow big price ranges.

The failed breakout triggers a reversal of sentiment, resulting in strong moves.

Entry is always on the 4th bar (the second consecutive “2”).

TIMEFRAME CONTINUITY IN REV STRATS

During Rev Strat setups, full timeframe continuity often breaks for a moment as the failed breakout occurs.

Ex: In a 3-1-2U-2D bearish Rev Strat, if all higher timeframes were red (bearish), the 2U on bar 3 briefly aligns to the upside, breaking continuity. When the 2D (bar 4) prints, continuity is restored bearishly. The same logic applies in reverse for bullish Rev Strats.

The momentary break is part of the trap, but the restoration of continuity after the reversal bar provides confirmation and a high-probability setup.

ENTRY AND EXIT RULES

Entry Rules (Pattern-Specific)

2-1-2 Pattern:

Bullish: Enter at inside bar high + $0.01

Bearish: Enter at inside bar low – $0.01

3-1-2 Pattern:

Bullish: Enter at inside bar high + $0.01

Bearish: Enter at inside bar low – $0.01

Rev Strat:

Bullish: Enter on the 2U reversal bar that follows a failed 2D breakout; target is high of the 1st bar.

Bearish: Enter on the 2D reversal bar after a failed 2U; target is low of the 1st bar.

2-2 Reversal:

Bullish: Enter at high of second 2U bar + $0.01

Bearish: Enter at low of second 2D bar – $0.01

Exit and Stop Rules

Always place stop loss at the opposite extreme of the entry candle or specific pattern-referenced bar.

Move stops to breakeven after 1:1 reward

Scale out profits at each pre-defined target

TARGET CALCULATION METHODS

For standard reversals: target previous high (bullish) or previous low (bearish)

For Rev Strat: target is always the extreme of the 1st bar in the 4-bar sequence

Broadenings: project the range of the formation from breakout point

Pivot Machine Gun: use series of recent pivots as scaling targets

TIMEFRAME CONTINUITY ANALYSIS

For high-probability trades, align at least 3 timeframes (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly) in the same direction.

During Rev Strats, accept the brief break of continuity; only enter when it is restored on the reversal bar.

Avoid trades when higher timeframes are mixed or inside bars.

RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

Position Sizing Rules

Base Risk: Never risk more than 1-2% of total capital per trade.

Calculation: (Account Size × Risk %) ÷ Stop Loss Distance = Position Size

Example 1 – Larger Account
Account Size: $10,000
Risk Per Trade: 2% = $200
Stop Loss Distance: $2.00
Position Size: $200 ÷ $2.00 = 100 shares

Example 2 – Smaller Account
Account Size: $1,000
Risk Per Trade: 2% = $20
Stop Loss Distance: $1.00
Position Size: $20 ÷ $1.00 = 20 shares

Partial profits: Take 1/3 off at 1:1, 1/3 at 2:1, let 1/3 run to target.

PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

Scan for patterns on daily/weekly charts.

Enter only when timeframes are aligned.

Wait for clear STRAT pattern, especially Rev Strat confirmation on bar 4.

Set stop at appropriate bar extreme.

Calculate position size before entering.

Scale out profits as targets are reached.

Move stop to breakeven once price has moved in your favor.

Never hold into a close if the pattern or timeframe continuity fails.

QUICK REFERENCE CARD

2-1-2: Entry at inside bar break + $0.01; stop = inside bar extreme

3-1-2: Entry at inside bar break + $0.01; stop = inside bar extreme

2-2: Entry at second bar’s high/low + $0.01 opposite the original trend; stop = second bar extreme

Rev Strat: Entry is always on the reversal bar (4th bar in sequence) after a failed 2U or 2D attempt; target = 1st bar’s extreme; stop = reversal bar extreme

Risk: No more than 2% of account on any trade

Timeframe: Align at least 3 timeframes; during Rev Strat, accept brief break but enter only when continuity is restored

All exits must be either at target or stop—never remove stops or move them against your trade
