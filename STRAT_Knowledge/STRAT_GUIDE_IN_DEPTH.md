# The Complete STRAT Trading Methodology Guide

## Understanding the STRAT philosophy

Rob Smith's STRAT methodology transforms trading from subjective prediction into objective pattern recognition based on universal market truths. Developed over 30 years of market analysis, the system recognizes that price can only move in three ways across any timeframe: consolidation (inward), expansion (outward), or directional movement. This elegant simplicity eliminates guesswork by focusing exclusively on what can be definitively known about price action.

The methodology's core question drives its philosophy: if traditional investment returns of 10-30% annually are considered exceptional, why do many trading vehicles achieve those returns in a single week? The answer lies in understanding that markets move in predictable patterns that repeat across all timeframes, creating opportunities when these patterns align. The STRAT identifies these opportunities through systematic pattern recognition rather than prediction, making it a mechanical, rule-based approach accessible to any trader willing to learn its principles.

## The three fundamental candle scenarios

Every candlestick in any market falls into exactly one of three scenarios, forming the foundation of STRAT analysis. **Scenario 1 (Inside Bar)** occurs when a candle's entire range sits within the previous candle's high and low. This represents market equilibrium where neither buyers nor sellers control direction. Inside bars act as consolidation zones and potential launching pads for significant moves once the market chooses direction.

**Scenario 2 (Directional Bar)** happens when price breaks either the previous high or low, but not both. A 2U (Two Up) breaks above the prior high while respecting the low, showing bullish momentum. A 2D (Two Down) breaks below the prior low while respecting the high, indicating bearish pressure. These directional bars confirm trend movement and provide the clearest signals of market intent. They represent successful attempts by either bulls or bears to move price beyond previous boundaries.

**Scenario 3 (Outside Bar)** forms when price breaks both the previous high and low, completely engulfing the prior candle's range. This expansion of volatility indicates failed initial directional attempts, as price must first go directional (Scenario 2) before becoming an outside bar. Outside bars create broadening formations and often signal major reversals or continuations. They represent maximum uncertainty and typically precede significant moves once resolved.

## Timeframe continuity: The heart of STRAT success

Timeframe continuity represents the methodology's most powerful concept, transforming random price movements into high-probability trading opportunities. When multiple timeframes align in the same direction, they create what Rob Smith called Full Timeframe Continuity (FTFC), where quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly charts all point the same way. This alignment indicates institutional money flow and dramatically increases trade success rates.

The system categorizes timeframes into **Tides** (monthly and weekly charts showing broad trends), **Waves** (daily charts revealing medium-term movements), and **Ripples** (hourly and lower timeframes for precise entries). Traders analyze from highest to lowest timeframe, identifying trend direction using 2-2 continuation patterns or 1-3 formations on each level. When current price sits above all timeframe opening prices, bullish continuity exists; below all opens indicates bearish continuity.

Partial continuity with at least two aligned higher timeframes still provides trading edge, though with lower probability than full alignment. The critical rule: never trade against higher timeframe direction. If any higher timeframe shows Scenario 1 (inside bar), trading ceases until that indecision resolves. This patience ensures traders only engage when probabilities heavily favor their position.

## Essential STRAT patterns and entry signals

The methodology combines the three basic scenarios into specific patterns that provide clear entry signals. **2-2 Reversal patterns** occur when two consecutive directional bars move in opposite directions. A 2D followed by 2U signals bullish reversal with entry one cent above the 2D high. Conversely, 2U followed by 2D indicates bearish reversal with entry one cent below the 2U low. These reversals often mark significant trend changes, especially when appearing at key support or resistance levels.

**2-1-2 Continuation patterns** show temporary consolidation before trend resumption. After an initial directional bar, an inside bar forms, followed by another directional bar in the original direction. Entry triggers on the break of the inside bar's range in the trend direction. The pattern confirms strong trends taking brief pauses before continuing. **3-1-2 Reversal patterns** begin with an outside bar showing volatility expansion, followed by inside bar consolidation, then directional resolution. This powerful reversal signal often appears at major trend turning points.

**3-2-2 patterns** start with an outside bar, then show a directional move that gets reversed by an opposite directional bar. Entry occurs when price breaks the middle bar's range against its direction. The pattern represents failed breakout attempts that trap traders on the wrong side. **Broadening formations** develop from consecutive outside bars or higher highs with lower lows, creating expanding volatility ranges. Traders can trade breakouts from the formation or fade the extremes for mean reversion.

## Risk management and stop loss placement

Effective STRAT risk management begins with precise stop placement based on pattern structure rather than arbitrary percentages. For inside bar breakouts, stops go just beyond the opposite side of the inside bar range. This placement respects the pattern's logic - if price returns through the inside bar, the breakout has failed. Switching to lower timeframes provides tighter stop levels using micro-structure swing points, allowing smaller initial risk and position scaling opportunities.

For reversal patterns like 2-2 or 3-1-2, stops extend beyond the pattern's extreme points. In a bullish 2-2 reversal, the stop sits below the lowest point of both directional bars. This gives the pattern room to work while maintaining logical invalidation levels. **Position sizing** starts conservatively at 1-2% account risk per trade, with capital reserved for scaling into winners. This approach allows traders to add to positions showing favorable development while keeping initial risk small.

The methodology emphasizes that stops should avoid obvious levels where retail traders cluster, preventing institutional stop hunting. Using swing points from multiple timeframes creates unique stop levels that respect price structure while avoiding common placement areas. Never move stops against your position once placed - if the pattern fails, accept the loss and wait for the next opportunity.

## Profit-taking strategies for different patterns

STRAT profit targets derive from pattern structure and market context rather than fixed ratios. **Pivot Machine Gun (PMG)** targets represent one of the most powerful concepts - when price makes five or more consecutive higher lows or lower highs before reversing, each of these pivot points becomes a profit target. Price tends to "machine gun" rapidly through these levels during reversal, allowing systematic profit-taking at each pivot.

For standard patterns, first targets typically aim for the pattern's opposite extreme or next significant swing point. In a 2-1-2 continuation, target the high of the initial directional bar or next resistance level. Scale out 25-50% at first target, moving stops to breakeven on remaining position. **Triangle They Out (TTO)** formations help identify extended targets by recognizing broadening patterns during trends. These formations indicate potential price magnitude, helping traders hold positions through minor retracements.

Measured moves project targets by extending the pattern's range from the breakout point. A 3-1-2 reversal pattern targets the outside bar's opposite extreme as minimum objective. Partial profit-taking maintains favorable risk-reward while allowing portions to run for extended targets. Trail stops using lower timeframe patterns to protect profits while maximizing potential gains. The key: let price structure guide targets rather than imposing arbitrary levels.

## How timeframe continuity drives entry decisions

Entry decisions in STRAT depend entirely on timeframe continuity confirmation. Before any pattern trade, verify higher timeframe alignment by checking if current price sits above or below relevant opening prices. Full continuity with all timeframes aligned provides maximum conviction for full position sizing. Partial continuity with 2-3 aligned timeframes warrants reduced size but still offers positive expectancy.

When timeframes conflict, such as weekly bullish but daily bearish, trading stops until resolution. This patience prevents fighting larger timeframe forces that ultimately drive price direction. **The current developing candle holds most weight** - if the 60-minute candle just turned directional, it supersedes historical daily or weekly positions until those timeframes update. This dynamic view keeps traders aligned with current market flow rather than outdated signals.

Higher timeframe patterns set directional bias while lower timeframes provide precise entry timing. If the daily shows a 2-2 bullish reversal, traders drop to hourly or 15-minute charts seeking continuation patterns for entry. This approach combines higher timeframe probability with lower timeframe precision, optimizing both win rate and risk-reward ratios. Never take lower timeframe signals against higher timeframe direction, regardless of pattern quality.

## Common STRAT setups and practical examples

The **2-2 Continuation** represents the simplest high-probability setup. When price shows two consecutive directional bars in the same direction (2U-2U or 2D-2D), it confirms strong momentum. Entry triggers on break above the second bar's high (bullish) or below its low (bearish). Stops sit beyond the first directional bar's opposite extreme. This pattern excels in trending markets with timeframe continuity.

**Inside Bar Breakouts** offer clear risk-reward when appearing at significant levels. After consolidation within the previous candle's range, price must choose direction. Entry occurs on decisive break above or below inside bar boundaries with stop at opposite extreme. These work best when the inside bar forms at support/resistance or after strong directional moves requiring pause. Always confirm higher timeframe direction before trading inside bar breaks.

The **1-3 Reversal** shows immediate volatility expansion after consolidation, creating broadening formation opportunities. The outside bar engulfing an inside bar signals major players entering positions. This pattern often appears at significant turning points where institutional activity increases. Trade both directions using the broadening range extremes, or wait for subsequent patterns to indicate directional resolution. Combined with timeframe continuity, these patterns offer exceptional risk-reward opportunities.

## Advanced STRAT concepts and actionable signals

Beyond basic patterns, STRAT incorporates **Hammer and Shooter** formations for reversal signals. A Hammer shows a lower wick at least three times the body size, appearing in downtrends to signal potential reversal. Shooters display upper wicks three times body size in uptrends, warning of exhaustion. These become actionable when appearing at 2U/2D levels or inside bar locations with timeframe continuity support.

**RevStrat patterns** represent three-bar reversal formations meeting specific criteria. The classic RevStrat shows an inside bar followed by directional break, then reversal through the inside bar's opposite boundary. This traps breakout traders while confirming reversal for STRAT practitioners. Entries trigger as price reclaims the inside bar range with stops beyond the false breakout extreme.

The methodology recognizes that patterns going "in-force" provide real-time entry signals without waiting for candle closes. Once price breaks a critical level confirming the pattern, traders enter immediately rather than waiting for period completion. This approach captures maximum movement while patterns remain valid. Failed patterns also provide information - a failed bullish setup often becomes a bearish opportunity, demonstrating the market's true intention.

## Implementing STRAT across different markets

STRAT patterns appear universally across all liquid markets, though each asset class presents unique considerations. **Stocks** excel for gap trading and earnings reactions, with patterns cleanly forming around these events. Focus on high-volume stocks and ETFs for best pattern clarity. The 24-hour **forex** market requires session awareness, as patterns may form differently during Asian, European, and American sessions. Major pairs provide best liquidity and pattern reliability.

**Futures markets** offer excellent STRAT opportunities with high liquidity and clear patterns. Index futures like ES, NQ, and YM show particularly clean formations during regular trading hours. **Cryptocurrency** markets trade continuously, creating patterns around the clock, though weekend volatility requires position size adjustment. Stick to major cryptocurrencies for sufficient liquidity ensuring patterns reflect genuine market sentiment rather than manipulation.

Regardless of market, the same principles apply: identify scenarios, confirm timeframe continuity, recognize patterns, and execute with proper risk management. The methodology's universality stems from its foundation in price action truth rather than market-specific indicators. This flexibility allows traders to apply STRAT concepts wherever opportunity appears, adapting only execution tactics for each market's characteristics.

## Building your STRAT trading system

Successful STRAT implementation requires systematic development starting with pattern recognition mastery. Begin by identifying scenarios 1, 2, and 3 on historical charts across multiple timeframes. Practice drawing these formations until recognition becomes automatic. Focus initially on one pattern type, such as 2-1-2 continuations, mastering entry, stop, and target rules before expanding to additional setups.

Establish timeframe continuity checking as a non-negotiable pre-trade routine. Create a checklist verifying quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly alignment before any position. This discipline prevents impulsive trades against larger forces. Document every trade in a detailed journal including pattern type, timeframe continuity status, entry, stop, targets, and results. Review this journal weekly to identify strengths and weaknesses in your application.

Technology enhances STRAT execution through platforms like TrendSpider offering built-in pattern recognition and TradingView providing community-developed indicators. These tools automate pattern scanning and timeframe analysis, allowing focus on trade management rather than pattern hunting. Start with simulation trading to build confidence, then transition to live markets with minimal position sizes. Gradually increase size only after demonstrating consistent profitability over at least 50 trades. Success comes from patience, discipline, and trust in the methodology's universal principles.

## Conclusion

The STRAT methodology transforms complex market analysis into objective pattern recognition based on three simple scenarios. By combining these scenarios into specific patterns and confirming with timeframe continuity, traders gain a mechanical approach to identifying high-probability opportunities. The system's strength lies not in predicting future movement but in recognizing current market structure and aligning with institutional flow.

Success requires dedication to mastering pattern recognition, unwavering discipline in following timeframe continuity rules, and systematic risk management protecting capital while maximizing gains. The methodology works universally across all liquid markets and timeframes, providing a complete trading system from entry to exit. Focus on perfect execution of high-probability setups rather than forcing trades, letting the market's natural patterns guide your decisions.

Remember that STRAT represents more than just patterns - it embodies a philosophy of trading only what can be known to be true, eliminating emotional decision-making through objective rules. Master the fundamentals, respect timeframe continuity, manage risk properly, and let the methodology's logical framework guide you toward consistent profitability. The patterns will appear; your job is recognizing and executing them with discipline and precision.
