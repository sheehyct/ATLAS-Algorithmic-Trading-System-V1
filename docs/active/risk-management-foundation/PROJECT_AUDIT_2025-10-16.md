# Project Audit - October 16, 2025

## Executive Summary

### Documentation vs Reality Gap

**CRITICAL FINDING:** Documentation is 4-15 days out of date with actual project state

## Gap Analysis: Theory vs Reality

### System Architecture Reference (Target State)

**5 Strategies Defined:**
1. GMM Regime Detection - NOT STARTED
2. Five-Day Washout Mean Reversion - NOT STARTED
3. Opening Range Breakout (ORB) - **IMPLEMENTED** (strategies/orb.py)
4. Pairs Trading - NOT STARTED
5. Semi-Volatility Momentum Portfolio - NOT STARTED

**Progress: 1/5 strategies (20%)**

### Core Components Progress

| Component | Architecture Spec | Current Reality | Status |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| BaseStrategy | Needed | Missing | NOT STARTED |
| PortfolioManager | Needed | Missing | NOT STARTED |
| RiskManager | Needed | Missing | NOT STARTED |
| position_sizer.py | Needed | utils/position_sizing.py exists | PARTIAL |
| AlpacaDataClient | Needed | data/alpaca.py exists | PARTIAL |
| MultiTimeframeManager | Needed | data/mtf_manager.py exists | EXISTS |

**Progress: 2.5/6 core components (42%)**

### Risk Management Framework

**HANDOFF.md Claims (Oct 12):**
- Week 1 Objective: Implement position sizing + portfolio heat
- Status: "Ready for Session 2C"
- **NOT TRUE** - Session 2C already happened!

**Actual Status (Oct 16):**
- Position Sizing: `utils/position_sizing.py` **EXISTS** (capital-constrained)
- Portfolio Heat: **MISSING** - No utils/portfolio_heat.py found
- Regime Detector: **MISSING** - No utils/regime_detector.py found

**Week 1 Progress: 1/2 objectives complete (50%)**

## Scaffolding vs Production Code

### Test/Verification Files (Can Archive/Delete)
- `examples/test_baseline.py` - Test scaffolding
- `verification_scripts/test_adjustment_types.py` - One-time verification
- `verification_scripts/verify_adjusted_data.py` - One-time verification
- `verification_scripts/verify_tradingview_data.py` - One-time verification
- `verification_scripts/verify_vbt_alpaca.py` - One-time verification

**Decision: Move verification_scripts/ to archives/ if tests passed**

### Empty Directories (Can Delete)
- `backtest/` - Only __init__.py
- `comparison/` - Only __init__.py
- `optimization/` - Only __init__.py

**Decision: Delete empty directories, recreate when needed**

---

## Documentation Issues

### CLAUDE.md (Oct 1 - 15 days old)

**Outdated Sections:**
- "What Was Fixed Today (October 1)" - Irrelevant now
- File structure lists 12 files - Actually 29 files
- No mention of ORB strategy or utils/position_sizing.py
- "Next Priorities" doesn't reflect current Week 1 objectives

**Needs Update:**
- Remove "What Was Fixed Today" (outdated daily log)
- Update file structure to current 29 files
- Add ORB strategy status
- Add position sizing implementation status
- Update to reflect System Architecture Reference targets

### HANDOFF.md (Oct 12 - 4 days old)

**Outdated Sections:**
- "Next Actions" says "Session 2C - Implement utils/position_sizing.py"
- Actually: Session 2C already happened (file exists)
- No mention of ORB strategy implementation (Oct 15)
- No mention of Alpaca authentication issue (Oct 15-16)

**Needs Update:**
- Current session: Beyond Week 1
- Position sizing: COMPLETE (with tests)
- ORB strategy: IMPLEMENTED (needs RTH filtering fix)
- Portfolio heat: NOT STARTED (Week 1 incomplete)
- Next objective: Complete Week 1 (portfolio heat) OR continue to Week 2-3 (GMM)

---

## Critical Path Forward

### Immediate Questions to Answer

1. **Where are we in the Week 1 plan?**
   - Position Sizing: DONE
   - Portfolio Heat: NOT STARTED
   - Decision: Complete Week 1 OR skip to ORB refinement?

2. **What's the priority?**
   - Option A: Finish Week 1 (implement portfolio heat manager)
   - Option B: Fix ORB RTH filtering issue (0 bars after filtering)
   - Option C: Move to Week 2-3 (GMM regime detection)

3. **Which files to keep vs archive?**
   - baseline_ma_rsi.py - Keep or archive? (HANDOFF says "abandon RSI")
   - verification_scripts/ - Archive if tests passed
   - trading/strat_signals.py - Keep or delete? (unclear purpose)

4. **Documentation priorities?**
   - Update HANDOFF.md to Oct 16 state
   - Restructure CLAUDE.md (make scannable, critical rules first)
   - Update git commit history in HANDOFF

---

## Recommendations

### Documentation Cleanup (Priority 1)

**HANDOFF.md:**
- Update "Session Date" to Oct 16, 2025
- Add "Session 2C-2F Complete" section
- Document position sizing implementation
- Document ORB strategy implementation
- Document Alpaca authentication fix
- Update "Next Actions" to reflect portfolio heat OR ORB refinement

**CLAUDE.md:**
- RESTRUCTURE using Anthropic best practices
- Move critical rules to top (lines 1-30)
- Remove "What Was Fixed Today" section
- Update file structure (29 files)
- Make rules more visual/scannable
- Add "NO EMOJIS" rule at top in all caps

**Create: PROJECT_STATUS.md**
- Simple 1-page current state
- What's done, what's in progress, what's next
- Updated after each session
- Replaces verbose HANDOFF sections

### Code Cleanup (Priority 2)

**Archive:**
- verification_scripts/ -> archives/verification/ (if tests passed)
- examples/test_baseline.py -> archives/examples/

**Delete:**
- Empty directories: backtest/, comparison/, optimization/ (recreate when needed)

**Clarify:**
- trading/strat_signals.py - Keep or delete? (check git history for purpose)
- baseline_ma_rsi.py - HANDOFF says abandon RSI, but file exists

### Technical Decisions (Priority 3)

**ORB Strategy RTH Filtering:**
- Current issue: 0 bars after RTH + trading day filters
- Root cause: Filters too aggressive or data timezone issue?
- Decision needed: Debug ORB filtering OR move to portfolio heat?

**Portfolio Heat Manager:**
- Week 1 objective incomplete
- Required for multi-strategy coordination
- Blocks GMM integration (Week 2-3)
- Decision: Implement now OR defer to after ORB works?

---

## Professional Standards Check

**VBT-First Methodology:** VIOLATED
- ORB strategy implemented without full VBT verification
- Resulted in 0 bars after filtering (integration issue)
- Should have tested VBT with RTH filters BEFORE full implementation

**Documentation Accuracy:** VIOLATED
- HANDOFF.md 4 days behind
- CLAUDE.md 15 days behind
- System Architecture creates new confusion (5 strategies planned, only 1 started)

**Isolation Strategy:** GOOD
- Work on feature branch (correct)
- Previous work archived (correct)
- Failures are isolatable

---

## Context for Next Session

**Token Usage:** 97.6k/200k (49%) - HEALTHY
**Branch:** feature/risk-management-foundation (correct)
**Last Working State:** Alpaca data fetching works (Oct 16)
**Blockers:**
1. ORB strategy gets 0 bars after RTH filtering
2. Portfolio heat manager not implemented (Week 1 incomplete)
3. Documentation severely out of date

**Recommended Next Session:**
1. Update documentation (HANDOFF, CLAUDE)
2. Decide: Fix ORB OR implement portfolio heat
3. Clean up scaffolding/verification files
4. Update git commits with proper state

---

**Audit Date:** October 16, 2025 (Post-Alpaca authentication fix)
**Auditor:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Next Review:** After completing current objective (TBD)
