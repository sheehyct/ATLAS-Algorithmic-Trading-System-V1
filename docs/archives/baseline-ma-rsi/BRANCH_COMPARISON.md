# Branch Comparison: TFC vs Baseline

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Branch 2 (Baseline) if:**
- ✅ You want proven results (30+ years of research)
- ✅ You prefer simplicity and maintainability
- ✅ You need a reliable benchmark
- ✅ You're new to algorithmic trading

**Choose Branch 1 (TFC) if:**
- ✅ You want to test your TFC innovation
- ✅ You're comfortable with higher complexity
- ✅ You have time for walk-forward optimization
- ✅ You accept risk of it not outperforming baseline

**Recommendation: Build Branch 2 FIRST, then Branch 1 for comparison.**

## Detailed Analysis

### Branch 1: TFC Confidence Score

#### Advantages
1. **Multi-factor confirmation** reduces false signals
2. **Confidence-based position sizing** optimizes risk-reward
3. **TFC innovation** may capture unique edge
4. **Flexible weights** can adapt to market conditions
5. **More sophisticated** than simple rules

#### Disadvantages
1. **Unproven approach** - no academic validation
2. **Complex implementation** - more code, more bugs
3. **Overfitting risk** - 4-5 parameters to optimize
4. **TFC dependency** - if TFC doesn't work, entire system fails
5. **Slower to develop** - requires TFC integration
6. **Harder to debug** - multi-factor interactions complex

#### Research Concerns

> "Simple systems with 2-3 parameters demonstrate greater robustness than complex multi-indicator approaches"

**Your TFC system has:**
- TFC weight
- RSI weight
- MACD weight
- Volume weight
- High confidence threshold
- Medium confidence threshold

**That's 6 parameters - above the recommended 2-3.**

> "44% of published trading strategies fail to replicate on new data"

**TFC has zero replication studies. It's untested outside your backtest.**

#### When TFC Makes Sense

**If your walk-forward analysis shows:**
- ✅ TFC Sharpe > Baseline Sharpe + 0.3 consistently
- ✅ TFC works across multiple market regimes (2008, 2020, 2022)
- ✅ TFC weights stable across walk-forward windows
- ✅ TFC doesn't degrade over time

**Then TFC adds value and is worth the complexity.**

### Branch 2: Baseline MA+RSI

#### Advantages
1. **Research-proven** - 75% win rate documented over 30 years
2. **Simple to implement** - 50 lines of code
3. **Easy to debug** - only 2 moving parts
4. **Low overfitting risk** - minimal parameters
5. **Fast to build** - 1-2 weeks vs 2-3 weeks
6. **Stable** - parameters don't need frequent reoptimization

#### Disadvantages
1. **Generic** - everyone knows this strategy
2. **No unique edge** - competing with other traders using same approach
3. **Binary decisions** - no position sizing flexibility
4. **Single timeframe** - 200-day MA less sophisticated than TFC
5. **May underperform** in certain regimes

#### Research Validation

> "The Connors 2-Period RSI achieved **75% win rates** with 0.5-0.66% gains per trade over 293 trades since 1993"

**This is documented, replicated, and proven.**

> "For short-term swing trading (days to weeks), multiple proven systems exist... Expected Sharpe ratios range from **1.0-2.0**"

**Baseline targets this exact range with minimal complexity.**

#### When Baseline Makes Sense

**If your walk-forward analysis shows:**
- ✅ Baseline Sharpe > 0.8 consistently
- ✅ Win rate > 55%
- ✅ Stable across market regimes
- ✅ TFC doesn't significantly outperform it

**Then Baseline is sufficient - no need for complexity.**

## Walk-Forward Comparison Checklist

After running walk-forward analysis on both, compare:

### Robustness Metrics

| Metric | Good Performance | Concerning |
|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Train-Test Sharpe Gap** | < 0.3 | > 0.5 |
| **Weight Stability** | Std dev < 0.1 | Std dev > 0.2 |
| **Win Rate Consistency** | Within ±5% | Varies ±10%+ |
| **Regime Performance** | Works in bull & bear | Only works in bull |
| **Degradation Over Time** | Improving or stable | Declining |

### Decision Matrix

**If TFC wins on all 5 metrics above:**
→ TFC is robust, deploy to paper trading

**If TFC wins on 3-4 metrics:**
→ TFC shows promise, deploy alongside Baseline for live A/B test

**If TFC wins on 1-2 metrics:**
→ TFC is marginal, stick with Baseline (simpler)

**If Baseline wins on 3+ metrics:**
→ Abandon TFC, use Baseline (proven approach)

## Code Complexity Comparison

### Baseline (Branch 2): ~150 Lines of Code

```python
# Pseudocode structure
class BaselineStrategy:
    def __init__(self, ma_period=200, rsi_period=2):
        # 2 parameters

    def generate_signals(self, close):
        ma = SMA(close, ma_period)
        rsi = RSI(close, rsi_period)

        long_entries = (close > ma) & (rsi < 15)
        long_exits = rsi > 85

        return long_entries, long_exits

    def backtest(self, data):
        # Simple portfolio simulation
        return portfolio
```

**Complexity: LOW**
- 1 file
- 2 indicators
- Simple boolean logic
- Easy to debug

### TFC Confidence (Branch 1): ~400 Lines of Code

```python
# Pseudocode structure
class TFCConfidenceStrategy:
    def __init__(self, tfc_w, rsi_w, macd_w, vol_w, ...):
        # 6+ parameters

    def calculate_tfc_score(self, data):
        # Multi-timeframe resampling
        # Bar classification on 3 timeframes
        # Alignment calculation
        return tfc_score  # Complex logic

    def calculate_confidence(self, data):
        # Factor 1: TFC (weighted)
        # Factor 2: RSI (weighted)
        # Factor 3: MACD (weighted)
        # Factor 4: Volume (weighted)
        return confidence  # Multi-factor math

    def generate_signals(self, data):
        confidence = self.calculate_confidence(data)

        high_conf = confidence >= 70
        med_conf = (confidence >= 50) & (confidence < 70)

        # Variable position sizing
        return signals  # Multiple entry types

    def backtest(self, data):
        # Complex portfolio with variable sizing
        return portfolio
```

**Complexity: HIGH**
- 3+ files (strategy + TFC + MTF manager)
- 6+ indicators/components
- Multi-factor calculations
- Confidence scoring math
- Variable position sizing
- Harder to debug (which factor caused entry?)

## Maintenance & Scaling

### Baseline

**Monthly maintenance: 1-2 hours**
- Review performance metrics
- Check if parameters still work (they should)
- Minimal reoptimization needed

**Scaling to new symbols:**
- Same parameters work across stocks
- No symbol-specific tuning needed

**Scaling to crypto (future):**
- May need to adjust RSI thresholds (higher volatility)
- MA period might change (shorter for crypto)

### TFC Confidence

**Monthly maintenance: 4-8 hours**
- Recalculate optimal weights via walk-forward
- Check if TFC calculation still valid
- Monitor confidence distribution
- Retrain if performance degrades

**Scaling to new symbols:**
- May need symbol-specific weight optimization
- TFC behavior different across asset classes
- More testing required per symbol

**Scaling to crypto (future):**
- TFC timeframes need adjustment (shorter)
- Weights may be completely different
- Essentially rebuild for each asset class

## Risk of Failure

### Baseline: 30-40% Failure Risk

**Reasons it might fail:**
1. Strategy too well-known (alpha decay)
2. Market regime change (momentum stops working)
3. Data quality issues (Alpaca data problems)
4. Execution slippage worse than assumed

**But:** 30 years of research says it works. Burden of proof is on YOU to execute it correctly.

### TFC Confidence: 50-60% Failure Risk

**Reasons it might fail:**
1. TFC doesn't actually predict returns (unproven)
2. Overfitted to historical data (6 parameters)
3. Confidence scoring adds noise, not signal
4. Complexity causes bugs (harder to debug)
5. All the baseline failure modes PLUS TFC-specific issues

**Reality:** You're testing a novel approach. 50%+ failure rate is expected for new strategies.

---

## Recommendation: Build Order

### Phase 1: Build Baseline (Week 1-2)

**Why first:**
- ✅ Establishes benchmark
- ✅ Validates your infrastructure (data, VBT, Alpaca)
- ✅ Tests your ability to execute research
- ✅ Gives you a working system quickly
- ✅ Proves concept works before adding complexity

**If Baseline fails:**
→ Problem is in execution/data, not strategy
→ Fix infrastructure before trying TFC

### Phase 2: Build TFC (Week 3-5)

**Why second:**
- ✅ You have working baseline to compare against
- ✅ You know infrastructure works
- ✅ You can measure if TFC adds value
- ✅ If TFC fails, you still have Baseline

**If TFC succeeds:**
→ Great! You've improved on research
→ Deploy TFC to paper trading

**If TFC fails:**
→ No problem, deploy Baseline
→ You still have a working system

### Phase 3: Live Comparison (Month 3-8)

Run both in paper trading:
- **Account 1:** Baseline only
- **Account 2:** TFC only
- **Account 3:** Both (50/50 allocation)

After 6 months, winner is clear. Deploy that to live trading.

---

## Final Verdict

**Branch 2 (Baseline) = Proven, Simple, Lower Risk**

Use this if:
- You want results fast
- You value simplicity
- You trust academic research
- You're new to algo trading

**Branch 1 (TFC) = Experimental, Complex, Higher Risk/Reward**

Use this if:
- You believe in TFC innovation
- You can handle complexity
- You accept 50%+ failure risk
- You want to test new ideas

**Optimal approach: Build both, let data decide.**

## Questions to Ask Yourself

Before choosing a branch:

**For Baseline:**
- [ ] Am I OK with a "generic" strategy everyone knows?
- [ ] Do I trust 30 years of academic research?
- [ ] Do I value simplicity over sophistication?
- [ ] Am I comfortable with "good enough" vs "optimal"?

**For TFC:**
- [ ] Do I believe TFC adds unique value?
- [ ] Can I commit 2-3 weeks to build it?
- [ ] Am I prepared for it to fail (50% chance)?
- [ ] Will I objectively compare it to Baseline (no sunk cost fallacy)?
- [ ] Can I debug 400 lines of multi-factor code?

**Answer truthfully. Your answers determine which branch to build first.**

## Next Steps

1. Decide: Baseline first, or TFC first, or both parallel?
2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for build steps
3. Read VALIDATION_PROTOCOL.md for testing requirements
4. Begin development on chosen branch
5. Track progress, commit early and often

**Still unsure? Build Baseline first. It's the safer choice.**
