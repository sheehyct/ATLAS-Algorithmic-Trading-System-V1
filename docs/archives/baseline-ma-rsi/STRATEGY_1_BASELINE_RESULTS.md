# Strategy 1: Baseline MA+RSI - Backtest Results & Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED - UNDERPERFORMING - NEEDS DEBUGGING
**Branch:** feature/baseline-ma-rsi

## Executive Summary

Strategy 1 (MA200 + RSI(2) mean reversion) has been successfully implemented and backtested on 4 years of SPY data (Oct 2021 - Oct 2025). The strategy is functional but significantly underperforms research expectations and buy-and-hold benchmark.

**Key Findings:**
- Win rate: 68.89% (MEETS expectations 60-75%)
- Sharpe ratio: 0.22 (FAILS expectations 0.8-1.2)
- Total return: 3.86% vs 54.41% buy-and-hold (UNDERPERFORMS by 50.55%)
- Trade count: 45 trades over 4 years (TOO LOW for statistical significance)
- Average trade: 0.06% (FAILS expectations 0.5-0.66%)

**Critical Issue:** Losses (-2.86% avg) are 2x larger than wins (+1.38% avg) - asymmetry in wrong direction.

**Recommendation:** Debug position sizing, exit logic, and parameter selection before proceeding to Strategy 2.

## Strategy Configuration

### Parameters
```python
ma_period = 200           # Trend filter
rsi_period = 2            # Mean reversion signal
rsi_oversold = 15.0       # Long entry threshold
rsi_overbought = 85.0     # Long exit threshold
atr_period = 14           # Volatility measurement
atr_multiplier = 2.0      # Stop-loss distance (2x ATR)
max_hold_days = 14        # Time-based exit
risk_per_trade = 0.02     # 2% risk per trade
```

### Entry Logic
- **Long Entry:** Close > MA200 AND RSI(2) < 15 (oversold in uptrend)
- **Long Exit:** RSI(2) > 85 (overbought)

### Exit Conditions
1. RSI overbought signal (RSI > 85)
2. Stop-loss: 2x ATR below entry
3. Take-profit: 4x ATR above entry (2:1 ratio)
4. Time-based: 14 days maximum hold

### Position Sizing
```python
position_size = (init_cash * 0.02) / (atr * 2.0)
```

### Risk Management
- Fees: 0.2% per trade
- Slippage: 0.1% per trade
- Initial capital: $10,000

## Critical Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Very Low Trade Count
**Problem:** 45 trades over 4 years = 11.25 trades/year

**Impact:**
- Statistically insignificant (need 100+ trades)
- Cannot validate strategy effectiveness
- High sensitivity to individual trade outcomes

**Possible Causes:**
- RSI(2) < 15 threshold too restrictive
- MA200 filter eliminating too many opportunities
- 2021-2025 period mostly bullish (fewer oversold conditions)

**Investigation Required:**
- Check signal distribution across time
- Test with RSI(2) < 20 or RSI(2) < 25
- Verify indicator calculations are correct

### Issue 2: Wrong Risk-Reward Asymmetry
**Problem:** Losses (-2.86%) are 2.07x larger than wins (+1.38%)

**Expected:** Wins should be 2x losses (due to 2:1 TP/SL ratio)

**Impact:**
- Destroys long-term profitability
- Indicates exits are wrong (hitting stops more than targets)
- Profit factor only 1.12 (barely positive)

**Possible Causes:**
- Stop-loss too tight (2x ATR might not be enough)
- Take-profit never reached (price reverses before 4x ATR)
- RSI exit signal (RSI > 85) triggers before profit target
- Slippage/fees eating into returns disproportionately

**Investigation Required:**
- Analyze exit types: how many hit SL vs TP vs RSI exit vs time exit?
- Check if 4x ATR profit targets are realistic
- Compare ATR values to price movement ranges

### Issue 3: Extremely Low Average Trade Return
**Problem:** 0.06% per trade vs expected 0.5-0.66%

**Impact:**
- Cannot overcome fees (0.2%) + slippage (0.1%) = 0.3% total costs
- Net returns barely positive after transaction costs
- Strategy not generating meaningful edge

**Possible Causes:**
- Position sizing too small (2% risk with tight stops = tiny positions)
- Early exits preventing profit capture
- Whipsaw in sideways markets
- ATR-based sizing creating inconsistent position sizes

**Investigation Required:**
- Examine actual position sizes vs available capital
- Calculate position size as % of portfolio
- Verify position sizing formula is correct
- Check if ATR values are reasonable

### Issue 4: Massive Underperformance vs Buy-and-Hold
**Problem:** 3.86% vs 54.41% (underperformance of 50.55%)

**Context:**
- 2021-2025 was strong bull market
- Mean reversion strategies underperform in trending markets
- SPY gained 54% - strategy captured almost none of it

**Implications:**
- Strategy may be fundamentally wrong for this market regime
- Sitting in cash too often (only 45 trades in 4 years)
- Missing major trend moves by waiting for oversold conditions

**Investigation Required:**
- Calculate time in market vs time in cash
- Check if strategy would work better in ranging/volatile markets
- Consider if trend-following component needed

### Issue 5: Low Sharpe Ratio
**Problem:** 0.22 vs expected 0.8-1.2

**Meaning:**
- Returns not compensating for risk taken
- High volatility relative to returns
- Not an efficient use of capital

**Investigation Required:**
- Compare drawdown periods to return periods
- Check if few large losses causing volatility spike
- Verify Sharpe calculation is annualized correctly

## VectorBT Pro API Learnings

**CRITICAL: These patterns apply to all future strategies**

### Properties vs Methods

**Portfolio-level stats are PROPERTIES (no parentheses):**
```python
pf.total_return          # Correct
pf.sharpe_ratio          # Correct
pf.max_drawdown          # Correct
```

**Trade-level count is METHOD (needs parentheses):**
```python
pf.trades.count()        # Correct - returns integer
pf.trades.count          # Wrong - returns <bound method>
```

**Trade-level stats are PROPERTIES:**
```python
pf.trades.win_rate       # Correct
pf.trades.profit_factor  # Correct
```

**Code Location:** `strategies/baseline_ma_rsi.py:198-210`

### Time-Based Exits

**WRONG (causes KeyError):**
```python
pf = vbt.PF.from_signals(
    time_delta_format='days',  # 'days' is not valid enum
    td_stop=14
)
```

**CORRECT:**
```python
pf = vbt.PF.from_signals(
    td_stop=pd.Timedelta(days=14),  # Use Timedelta object
    freq='1D'
)
```

**Alternative (string format):**
```python
td_stop="14 days"  # Also works
```

**Code Location:** `strategies/baseline_ma_rsi.py:179`

### Getting Trade Statistics

**Recommended approach:**
```python
trade_count = pf.trades.count()  # Call once, store result

stats = {
    'total_return': pf.total_return,
    'sharpe_ratio': pf.sharpe_ratio,
    'total_trades': trade_count,
    'avg_trade_return': pf.trades.returns.mean() if trade_count > 0 else 0.0
}
```

**Alternative (comprehensive stats):**
```python
all_stats = pf.trades.stats()  # Returns Series with all metrics
```

## Code Implementation

### File Structure
```
strategies/
├── __init__.py
├── baseline_ma_rsi.py       # Strategy class (263 lines)
└── backtest_baseline.py     # Backtesting script (temporary)
```

### Key Methods

**Signal Generation** (`baseline_ma_rsi.py:71-120`)
```python
def generate_signals(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> Dict[str, pd.Series]:
    # Calculate indicators
    ma200 = vbt.talib("SMA").run(close, timeperiod=self.ma_period).real
    rsi = vbt.talib("RSI").run(close, timeperiod=self.rsi_period).real
    atr = vbt.talib("ATR").run(high, low, close, timeperiod=self.atr_period).real

    # Entry/Exit logic
    uptrend = close > ma200
    oversold = rsi < self.rsi_oversold
    long_entries = uptrend & oversold

    overbought = rsi > self.rsi_overbought
    long_exits = overbought

    return {...}
```

**Backtesting** (`baseline_ma_rsi.py:122-183`)
```python
def backtest(self, data: pd.DataFrame, init_cash=10000, fees=0.002, slippage=0.001, risk_per_trade=0.02):
    signals = self.generate_signals(data)

    # Position sizing
    stop_distance = signals['atr'] * self.atr_multiplier
    position_size = init_cash * risk_per_trade / stop_distance
    position_size = position_size.replace([np.inf, -np.inf], 0).fillna(0)

    # Run portfolio
    pf = vbt.PF.from_signals(
        close=close,
        entries=signals['long_entries'],
        exits=signals['long_exits'],
        size=position_size,
        size_type="amount",
        init_cash=init_cash,
        fees=fees,
        slippage=slippage,
        sl_stop=stop_distance,
        tp_stop=stop_distance * 2,
        td_stop=pd.Timedelta(days=self.max_hold_days),
        freq='1D'
    )
    return pf
```

### Bugs Fixed During Development

**Bug 1: time_delta_format KeyError**
- Error: `KeyError: 'days'`
- Cause: `time_delta_format='days'` is not valid VectorBT Pro enum
- Fix: Use `td_stop=pd.Timedelta(days=14)` instead
- Location: Line 179

**Bug 2: Stats extraction calling properties as methods**
- Error: `'numpy.float64' object is not callable`
- Cause: Called `pf.total_return()` instead of `pf.total_return`
- Fix: Remove `()` from portfolio-level stats
- Location: Lines 198-200

**Bug 3: Trade count comparison error**
- Error: `'>' not supported between instances of 'method' and 'int'`
- Cause: Used `pf.trades.count` in conditional without calling it
- Fix: Call `pf.trades.count()` first, store result
- Location: Lines 203-207

## Next Steps: Required Investigations

### Investigation 1: Trade-Level Analysis

**Goal:** Understand why losses > wins despite 2:1 TP/SL setup

**Actions:**
1. Extract full trade log from `pf.trades.records_readable`
2. Categorize exits by type:
   - Stop-loss hit
   - Take-profit hit
   - RSI overbought exit
   - Time-based exit (14 days)
3. Calculate statistics per exit type
4. Identify which exit is dominant

**Code to run:**
```python
trades = pf.trades.records_readable
exit_types = trades['Exit Type']  # Or equivalent field
print(exit_types.value_counts())
```

**Expected insight:** If most trades hit stop-loss, indicates stops too tight or targets unrealistic.

### Investigation 2: Position Sizing Verification

**Goal:** Verify position sizing formula is working correctly

**Actions:**
1. Extract position sizes from backtest
2. Calculate position size as % of portfolio value
3. Check if positions are suspiciously small
4. Verify ATR values are reasonable (should be 1-3% of close price)

**Code to run:**
```python
signals = strategy.generate_signals(daily_data)
atr = signals['atr']
close = daily_data['Close']
atr_pct = (atr / close) * 100

print(f"ATR as % of close: min={atr_pct.min():.2f}%, max={atr_pct.max():.2f}%, mean={atr_pct.mean():.2f}%")

stop_distance = atr * 2.0
position_size = 10000 * 0.02 / stop_distance
position_pct = (position_size * close) / 10000 * 100

print(f"Position as % of portfolio: min={position_pct.min():.2f}%, max={position_pct.max():.2f}%, mean={position_pct.mean():.2f}%")
```

**Expected insight:** If positions are < 5% of portfolio, indicates sizing is too conservative.

### Investigation 3: Parameter Sensitivity Testing

**Goal:** Determine if RSI threshold is too restrictive

**Actions:**
1. Re-run backtest with RSI < 20 (instead of < 15)
2. Re-run backtest with RSI < 25
3. Compare trade counts and returns
4. Test MA period variations (100, 150, 200)

**Code to run:**
```python
for rsi_threshold in [15, 20, 25, 30]:
    strategy = BaselineStrategy(rsi_oversold=rsi_threshold)
    pf = strategy.backtest(daily_data)
    stats = strategy.get_performance_stats(pf)
    print(f"RSI < {rsi_threshold}: Trades={stats['total_trades']}, Return={stats['total_return']:.2%}, Sharpe={stats['sharpe_ratio']:.2f}")
```

**Expected insight:** If higher thresholds generate significantly more trades with similar win rates, indicates original threshold too restrictive.

## Research Comparison

### Expected Performance (Connors Research)
- Win Rate: 75% (documented over 30 years)
- Average Trade: 0.5-0.66%
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.8-1.2
- Consistent profitability across market conditions

### Actual Performance (This Backtest)
- Win Rate: 68.89% (CLOSE)
- Average Trade: 0.06% (MUCH LOWER)
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.22 (MUCH LOWER)
- Underperforms in bull market

### Possible Explanations

**1. Different Market Regime**
- Research may cover different time periods (more volatile markets)
- 2021-2025 was mostly bullish with low volatility
- Mean reversion works better in ranging/choppy markets

**2. Implementation Differences**
- Research may use different position sizing
- May have different exit logic (e.g., profit targets vs fixed exits)
- Fees and slippage assumptions may differ
- May trade multiple symbols (diversification)

**3. Parameter Differences**
- Research may use different RSI thresholds
- May use different MA periods
- May have additional filters not documented

**4. Data Differences**
- Research may test on broader universe (not just SPY)
- May include stocks with different volatility profiles
- Survivorship bias in research (tested on winners)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Strategy 2)
1. **Complete 3 investigations** listed above
2. **Fix identified issues** (position sizing, exit logic, parameters)
3. **Re-run backtest** with fixes applied
4. **Document improvements** and updated results

### If Strategy Remains Underperforming
1. **Consider regime detection** - only trade in ranging markets
2. **Test on different symbols** - may work better on individual stocks
3. **Simplify to pure Connors RSI** - remove MA filter, test if improves
4. **Accept limitations** - may not be suitable for strong bull markets

### Before Paper Trading
- Strategy must achieve:
  - Sharpe > 0.8
  - 100+ trades for statistical significance
  - Avg trade > 0.5%
  - Positive asymmetry (wins > losses)
- If cannot achieve these, Strategy 2/3 may be better candidates

### For Strategy 2 & 3 Development
- **Reuse VectorBT API patterns** documented here
- **Start with longer backtest periods** (10+ years if data available)
- **Test in multiple market regimes** (bull, bear, sideways)
- **Consider regime detection** from asymmetric document

---

## Context for Next Session

**What was accomplished:**
- Strategy 1 fully implemented and functional
- 4-year backtest completed successfully

## SESSION 2 FINDINGS: Complete Analysis (2025-10-11)

### Investigation 1: Long vs Short Performance Breakdown

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Strategy trades BOTH longs and shorts (not documented in initial testing).

**Performance by Direction:**

| Direction | Trades | Avg Return | Win Rate | Avg Winner | Avg Loser |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LONG** | 35 (77.8%) | +0.27% | 74.3% | +1.20% | -2.42% |
| **SHORT** | 10 (22.2%) | -0.68% | 50.0% | +2.29% | -3.64% |
| **COMBINED** | 45 (100%) | +0.06% | 68.9% | +1.38% | -2.86% |

**Key Findings:**

1. **Shorts Are Losing Money**
   - Occurred primarily in 2022-2023 volatile period
   - 30% hit stops as market kept rising (bull market)
   - 40% timed out losing (-4.35% avg on time exits)
   - **NOT viable in 2021-2025 bull market regime**

2. **Longs Barely Profitable**
   - +0.27% avg cannot overcome 0.3% transaction costs (0.2% fees + 0.1% slippage)
   - **Net expected return = NEGATIVE after real costs**
   - Win rate high (74%) but winners too small (+1.20%)
   - Losers still 2x winners (-2.42% vs +1.20%)

3. **Exit Pattern Reveals Core Issue**
   - LONG trades: 0 stop-losses, 2 take-profits (5.7%), 24 signal exits (68.6%), 9 time exits (25.7%)
   - **Only 5.7% of longs hit take-profit target** - RSI exits cutting winners short
   - Time exits losing -2.04% avg - 14 days insufficient for trend development

**Decision:** Shorts MUST be disabled for any production deployment (no margin account needed anyway).

### Investigation 2: Exit Type Analysis

Categorized all 45 trades by actual exit reason:

**Exit Type Distribution:**

| Exit Type | Count | % of Total | Avg Return | Avg Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Signal Exit (RSI)** | 27 | 60.0% | +0.81% | 7.8 days |
| **Time Exit (14 days)** | 13 | 28.9% | -2.75% | 14.0 days |
| **Stop-Loss** | 3 | 6.7% | +3.48% | 4.0 days |
| **Take-Profit** | 2 | 4.4% | +3.00% | 8.0 days |

**Critical Findings:**

1. **Take-Profits Rarely Hit (4.4%)**
   - 2:1 TP/SL ratio is **theoretical only**
   - RSI overbought signal (60% of exits) cuts winners short before TP reached
   - Average signal exit: +0.81% (well below 2:1 target)

2. **Time Exits Are Losing (-2.75%)**
   - 13 out of 45 trades (28.9%) hit 14-day timeout
   - Indicates trades not developing in expected timeframe
   - Bull market = long trends, 14 days too short

3. **Stop-Loss Performance Anomaly**
   - 3 stop-losses show +3.48% avg return (positive!)
   - **Explanation:** These were SHORT trades (sell high, stopped out lower = profit)
   - Confirms shorts performed better on exits than entries

4. **Signal Exits Dominate (60%)**
   - RSI > 85 exit triggering on 27 out of 45 trades
   - Cuts winners at +0.81% avg (below costs after fees)
   - **This is the Connors design** (mean reversion, quick in/out)
   - Incompatible with asymmetric 2:1+ R:R goals

### The Fundamental Conflict

**WE MIXED TWO OPPOSITE PHILOSOPHIES:**

**Connors Approach (Research):**
- High win rate (75%), low R:R
- Quick exits via RSI signal
- 0.5-0.66% per trade
- Works in ranging/choppy markets

**Asymmetric Approach (Our Goal):**
- Low win rate (30-50%), high R:R (2:1 to 5:1)
- Let winners run to targets
- Large gains offset small losses
- Works in trending markets

**Our Implementation:**
- ✅ Connors ENTRIES (RSI oversold) → Getting 74% win rate
- ❌ Asymmetric EXITS (TP/SL/time) → Only 4.4% hit targets
- ❌ RSI signal exit (Connors) → Cuts winners at 0.81%
- **Result:** HYBRID FAILURE - neither philosophy working

### Root Cause Analysis

**Why Strategy 1 Failed in 2021-2025:**

1. **Wrong Regime**
   - Bull market (+54% SPY) = strong uptrends
   - Mean reversion underperforms in trending markets
   - Better suited for ranging/volatile markets (2022 was exception)

2. **Exit Logic Conflict**
   - Connors RSI exit (60% of trades) prevents asymmetric payoffs
   - Take-profit targets unreachable (4.4% hit rate)
   - Time exits too short for bull market trends

3. **Shorts Fighting Trend**
   - 22% of trades were shorts in bull market
   - Shorts averaged -0.68% (consistent losses)
   - Dragged overall performance down

### TFC Analysis Context (Brief)

**Note:** TFC analysis was run to inform Strategy 3 design, not part of Strategy 1 scope.

**Key Finding:** 39.5% of time has high-confidence TFC/FTFC alignment (3/4 or 4/4 timeframes).
- Bullish bias: 2.5:1 (284 bullish vs 113 bearish bars)
- Confirms 2021-2025 bull market regime
- Validates Strategy 2 (ORB breakout) for trending markets
- Strategy 3 needs dynamic allocation (TFC as filter, not sole signal)

**Full TFC findings documented in HANDOFF.md** for Strategy 3 branch planning.

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION

**Strategy 1 Status: ARCHIVE FOR BEAR MARKET TESTING**

**Decision Rationale:**

1. **Longs barely profitable (+0.27%)** - cannot overcome transaction costs
2. **Shorts losing (-0.68%)** - not viable in bull markets
3. **Wrong regime** - mean reversion fails in 2021-2025 trending market
4. **Exit conflict** - Connors quick exits incompatible with asymmetric goals
5. **Low trade count (45)** - insufficient statistical significance

**NOT Recommended for:**
- Production deployment as-is
- Paper trading in current market conditions
- Further optimization (diminishing returns)

**MAY Be Viable for:**
- Bear market / ranging market regimes (2022-style volatility)
- As fallback strategy in Strategy 3 hybrid (when TFC low + ranging)
- Different asset (individual stocks vs SPY index)

**Next Steps:**
1. **Disable shorts** if keeping for future use (2-line code change)
2. **Move to Strategy 2** (Opening Range Breakout)
   - Designed for trending markets ✓
   - Asymmetric R:R profile (17% win rate, 2.396 Sharpe in research) ✓
   - Matches 2021-2025 regime ✓
3. **Build Strategy 3** (TFC Hybrid)
   - Use TFC for dynamic allocation
   - Switch between strategies based on alignment + regime
