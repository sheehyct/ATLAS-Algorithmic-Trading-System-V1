# Strategy 2 (ORB) Implementation Plan - Critical Addendum

**Document Purpose:** Updates to Claude Code's implementation plan based on Advanced Algorithmic Trading Systems research  
**Date:** 2025-10-11  
**Status:** APPROVED - MUST READ BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Contains mandatory corrections to original plan

---

## Executive Summary for Claude Code

Claude Code's 7-phase plan is **excellent in structure** but has **6 critical gaps** that must be addressed:

1. ✅ **Volume confirmation is MANDATORY** (not optional) - 2.0× threshold required
2. ✅ **Sharpe ratio targets must be doubled** - Backtest Sharpe 2.0+ needed for real-world 1.0+
3. ✅ **R:R ratio minimum is 3:1** (not 2:1) - Math shows 2:1 is not viable
4. ✅ **Expectancy calculation needs 80% efficiency factor** - Add to validation
5. ✅ **STRAT-lite bias filter available** - Optional Phase 4 enhancement
6. ✅ **ATR multiplier may need 3.0×** - Test both 2.5× and 3.0×

**These are not suggestions - they are corrections based on peer-reviewed research and mathematical proofs.**

## Critical Corrections to Original Plan

### Correction 1: Volume Confirmation is MANDATORY

**Original Plan Status:** Not mentioned in any phase

**Research Evidence:**
> "Breakouts accompanied by 2× average volume achieve ~53% success rates whereas breakouts without volume confirmation had a much higher failure rate"

**Impact Without This:**
- Win rate will likely be 35-40% instead of expected 17-25%
- More false breakouts
- Lower R:R ratio
- Strategy may fail Phase 2 validation

**Required Implementation (Phase 1.3):**

```python
# Phase 1.3 Entry Logic - MANDATORY ADDITION

def generate_signals(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> dict:
    """Generate entry signals with MANDATORY volume confirmation."""
    
    # Calculate opening range
    opening_high = data['High'][opening_period].max()
    opening_low = data['Low'][opening_period].min()
    opening_close = data['Close'][opening_period].iloc[-1]
    opening_open = data['Open'][opening_period].iloc[0]
    
    # Directional bias
    bullish_opening = opening_close > opening_open
    bearish_opening = opening_close < opening_open
    
    # Price breakout
    price_breakout_long = data['Close'] > opening_high
    price_breakout_short = data['Close'] < opening_low
    
    # CRITICAL: Volume confirmation (MANDATORY)
    volume_ma_20 = data['Volume'].rolling(20).mean()
    volume_surge = data['Volume'] > (volume_ma_20 * 2.0)  # 2.0× threshold
    
    # Entry signals (volume confirmation REQUIRED)
    long_entries = price_breakout_long & bullish_opening & volume_surge
    short_entries = price_breakout_short & bearish_opening & volume_surge
    
    return {
        'long_entries': long_entries,
        'short_entries': short_entries,
        'volume_confirmed': volume_surge,  # Track for analysis
        'volume_ma': volume_ma_20
    }
```

**Why 2.0× (not 1.5× or optional):**
- Research specifically tested 2× threshold
- 1.5× may pass too many false signals
- Making it optional defeats the purpose (you'll optimize it away)
- 53% success rate is already low for breakouts - don't make it worse

**Phase 2 Validation Must Check:**
```python
# In Phase 2.1 Full Backtest
trades = pf.trades.records_readable

# Extract volume confirmation rate
# (This requires storing volume data at entry time)
volume_confirmed_trades = trades['volume_surge'].sum()
total_trades = len(trades)
confirmation_rate = volume_confirmed_trades / total_trades

print(f"Volume confirmation rate: {confirmation_rate:.1%}")
print(f"Expected: 100% (mandatory filter)")

if confirmation_rate < 0.95:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: Volume filter not working correctly")
```

---

### Correction 2: Sharpe Ratio Targets Must Account for Overfitting Haircut

**Original Plan:**
- Minimum Sharpe: > 1.0
- Target Sharpe: > 1.5

**Research Evidence:**
> "Backtests should be 'haircut' for overfitting bias - cut Sharpe in half to account for data mining"
> "If backtest shows Sharpe 2.0, assume real world might be Sharpe ~1.0"

**The Problem:**
- If your backtest shows Sharpe 1.0, real-world will be ~0.5 (not viable)
- If your backtest shows Sharpe 1.5, real-world will be ~0.75 (marginal)
- Professional quant funds target real-world Sharpe 1.5-2.5

**Updated Targets:**

| Metric | Original Target | Corrected Target | Real-World Expectation |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Minimum Sharpe | 1.0 | 2.0 | ~1.0 after haircut |
| Target Sharpe | 1.5 | 2.5-3.0 | ~1.25-1.5 after haircut |
| Excellent Sharpe | 2.0+ | 3.0+ | ~1.5+ after haircut |

**Updated Phase 2.1 Success Criteria:**

```markdown
### Phase 2.1 Full Backtest - Updated Metrics

Extract performance metrics:
- Win rate (expect 15-25%)
- Avg winner vs avg loser (expect 4:1+ R:R) ← CHANGED from 2.5:1+
- **Sharpe ratio (expect 2.0+ minimum, 2.5+ target)** ← CHANGED from 1.0+ min
- Trade count (need 100+ minimum)
- Avg trade return (expect 0.6%+ after costs) ← CHANGED from 0.5%+
- Max drawdown (expect < 25%)

Red Flags:
- Sharpe < 2.0: Real-world will be < 1.0 (not viable) ← CHANGED from 1.0
- Win rate > 30%: Likely have signal exits cutting winners
- R:R < 3:1: Stops too tight or exits too early ← CHANGED from 2:1
- Trade count < 100: Insufficient statistical power
- Avg trade < 0.6%: Below transaction cost viability ← CHANGED from 0.5%
```

**Why This Matters:**

Professional quant teams know that:
1. In-sample optimization inflates metrics
2. Data mining bias affects all backtests
3. Real markets are messier than historical data
4. 50% haircut is industry-standard conservative estimate

**Don't fool yourself with good-looking backtests that will fail in production.**

---

### Correction 3: R:R Ratio Minimum is 3:1 (Not 2:1)

**Original Plan:**
- R:R > 2:1 minimum

**Mathematical Proof Why 2:1 is Insufficient:**

Let's calculate expectancy for a 20% win rate strategy with different R:R ratios:

**Scenario A: 2.5:1 R:R (Your Original Target)**
```
Assumptions:
- Win rate: 20%
- Avg winner: 2.5%
- Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical expectancy:
(0.20 × 2.5%) - (0.80 × 1.0%) = 0.50% - 0.80% = -0.30%

Already losing money theoretically!
```

**Scenario B: 3:1 R:R (Minimum Viable)**
```
Assumptions:
- Win rate: 20%
- Avg winner: 3.0%
- Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical expectancy:
(0.20 × 3.0%) - (0.80 × 1.0%) = 0.60% - 0.80% = -0.20%

Still losing money!
```

**Scenario C: 4:1 R:R (Actually Viable)**
```
Assumptions:
- Win rate: 20%
- Avg winner: 4.0%
- Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical expectancy:
(0.20 × 4.0%) - (0.80 × 1.0%) = 0.80% - 0.80% = 0.00%

Breakeven theoretically, but then:
- Realized (80% efficiency): 0.00% × 0.80 = 0.00%
- After costs (0.35%): 0.00% - 0.35% = -0.35%

STILL LOSING!
```

**Scenario D: 5:1 R:R (Comfortable Margin)**
```
Assumptions:
- Win rate: 20%
- Avg winner: 5.0%
- Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical expectancy:
(0.20 × 5.0%) - (0.80 × 1.0%) = 1.00% - 0.80% = 0.20%

Realized (80% efficiency): 0.20% × 0.80 = 0.16%
After costs (0.35%): 0.16% - 0.35% = -0.19%

MARGINAL (barely losing)
```

**Scenario E: 25% Win Rate, 4:1 R:R (Research Sweet Spot)**
```
Assumptions:
- Win rate: 25%
- Avg winner: 4.0%
- Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical expectancy:
(0.25 × 4.0%) - (0.75 × 1.0%) = 1.00% - 0.75% = 0.25%

Realized (80% efficiency): 0.25% × 0.80 = 0.20%
After costs (0.35%): 0.20% - 0.35% = -0.15%

STILL MARGINAL!
```

**The Reality:**

For ORB with 20% win rate to be viable, you need **EITHER:**
- Win rate 25%+ with 4:1 R:R, OR
- Win rate 20% with 6:1+ R:R

**Updated Success Criteria:**

```markdown
Success Criteria - Risk:Reward Updates:

Minimum Viable:
- ✓ R:R ratio: > 3:1 minimum (not 2:1)
- ✓ Target: 4:1 for solid profitability
- ✓ Excellent: 5:1+ creates comfortable margin

Phase 2 Decision Gate:
- PASS: R:R > 3:1 with win rate 20-25%
- BORDERLINE: R:R 2.5-3:1 (proceed with caution, document risk)
- FAIL: R:R < 2.5:1 (strategy not viable, must debug)
```

**What This Means for Implementation:**

If Phase 2 backtest shows R:R < 3:1, you must:
1. Widen stops (try 3.0× ATR instead of 2.5×)
2. Let winners run longer (verify no signal exits cutting winners)
3. Add take-profit targets at 4-5× stop distance (optional)
4. Consider strategy not viable for current market conditions

---

### Correction 4: Add Expectancy Efficiency Factor to Validation

**Original Plan:** No mention of realized vs theoretical expectancy

**Research Evidence:**
> "One subtle drawback of fixed-percent risk is that realized growth is slightly less than raw expectancy"
> "Strategy expected 0.20 (20%) per trade ended up realizing ~0.16% (80% efficiency)"

**Why This Matters:**

Fixed fractional position sizing (which you're using) has a mathematical drag:
- Percentage losses hurt more than equal percentage gains help
- Geometric mean < Arithmetic mean
- Typical efficiency: ~80% of theoretical expectancy

**This means your backtest will underperform theoretical math by ~20%.**

**Required Addition to Phase 2.2:**

```python
# Phase 2.2 Compare to Expectations - ADD THIS SECTION

def calculate_expectancy_analysis(pf):
    """

```

### Correction 5: STRAT-lite Bias Filter Available (Optional Phase 4 Addition)

**Original Plan:** No mention of STRAT/TFC integration (planned for Strategy 3)

**Research Evidence:** Advanced Systems document provides complete VectorBT implementation

**Opportunity:**

The simplified STRAT-lite bias filter can be added as an **optional enhancement** in Phase 4 to test if timeframe continuity improves performance.

**This is NOT mandatory for Strategy 2**, but if it shows >15% Sharpe improvement, consider including it as a core feature.

**New Phase 4.6 (Optional):**

```markdown
### Phase 4.6: STRAT-lite Bias Filter (OPTIONAL - 4 hours)

**Purpose:** Test if timeframe continuity filter improves win rate and Sharpe

**Background:**
- STRAT methodology: Trade only when multiple timeframes aligned
- Simplified "STRAT-lite": Calculate bias score, filter entries
- Research shows this can improve win rate 5-10% with 20-30% fewer trades

**Implementation:**

```python
def calculate_strat_bias(data_dict: dict) -> pd.Series:
    """
    Calculate STRAT-lite bias score across multiple timeframes.
    
    Args:
        data_dict: Dict mapping timeframe labels to OHLC DataFrames
                  e.g. {'5T': df_5min, '15T': df_15min, '60T': df_1hr, '1D': df_daily}
    
    Returns:
        bias_score: Series with values -1 to +1 indicating directional bias
    """
    
    def compute_tf_bias(df):
        """Compute bias for single timeframe."""
        # Identify breaks of previous high/low
        high_break = df['High'] > df['High'].shift(1)
        low_break = df['Low'] < df['Low'].shift(1)
        
        # Assign +1 for 2u (up break), -1 for 2d (down break), 0 otherwise
        return np.where(
            high_break & ~low_break, 1,      # 2u: broke high only
            np.where(
                low_break & ~high_break, -1,  # 2d: broke low only
                0                             # Inside or outside bar
            )
        )
    
    # Compute bias for each timeframe
    bias_values = []
    for tf_label, tf_df in data_dict.items():
        bias_val = pd.Series(compute_tf_bias(tf_df), index=tf_df.index)
        
        # Forward-fill to match finest timeframe (5T)
        base_index = data_dict['5T'].index
        bias_val = bias_val.reindex(base_index, method='ffill')
        
        bias_values.append(bias_val)
    
    # Stack and compute average bias score
    bias_matrix = pd.concat(bias_values, axis=1)
    bias_score = bias_matrix.mean(axis=1)
    
    return bias_score

# Usage in strategy
timeframes = {
    '5T': intraday_5min_data,
    '15T': intraday_15min_data,
    '60T': intraday_60min_data,
    '1D': daily_data
}

bias_score = calculate_strat_bias(timeframes)

# Create bias masks
long_bias = bias_score >= 0.4   # 40%+ timeframes bullish
short_bias = bias_score <= -0.4  # 40%+ timeframes bearish

# Filter entries
filtered_long_entries = base_long_entries & long_bias
filtered_short_entries = base_short_entries & short_bias
```

**Testing Protocol:**

1. Run baseline backtest (without bias filter)
2. Run filtered backtest (with bias filter)
3. Compare metrics:

```python
# Comparison analysis
baseline_sharpe = baseline_pf.sharpe_ratio
filtered_sharpe = filtered_pf.sharpe_ratio

baseline_trades = baseline_pf.trades.count()
filtered_trades = filtered_pf.trades.count()

improvement = (filtered_sharpe - baseline_sharpe) / baseline_sharpe

print(f"Baseline: Sharpe {baseline_sharpe:.2f}, {baseline_trades} trades")
print(f"Filtered: Sharpe {filtered_sharpe:.2f}, {filtered_trades} trades")
print(f"Improvement: {improvement:.1%}")
print(f"Trade reduction: {(1 - filtered_trades/baseline_trades):.1%}")

# Decision criteria
if improvement > 0.15:  # >15% Sharpe improvement
    print("✓ EXCELLENT: Include STRAT-lite as core feature")
elif improvement > 0.05:  # 5-15% improvement
    print("✓ GOOD: Consider including, document trade-off")
else:
    print("⚠️ MARGINAL: Skip for Strategy 2, revisit in Strategy 3")
```

**Decision:**
- If Sharpe improvement > 15%: Make it core feature
- If improvement 5-15%: Optional, document for Strategy 3
- If improvement < 5%: Skip, adds complexity without benefit

**Why This is Optional:**

1. Strategy 2 is already complex (intraday ORB)
2. STRAT-lite requires multi-timeframe data management
3. If baseline ORB doesn't work, STRAT won't save it
4. Better to validate core ORB logic first
5. Strategy 3 will integrate this properly anyway

**But Test It Anyway:**

Even if you don't include it in Strategy 2, document the results for Strategy 3 design.
```

### Correction 6: ATR Stop Multiplier - Test 3.0× as Well

**Original Plan:** 2.5× ATR stop (Phase 4.2 tests 2.0×, 2.5×, 3.0×)

**Analysis:** Your plan already includes this, but emphasis needed

**Research Context:**
- ORB with 17% win rate suggests very wide stops needed
- "Winners 2.5-4× losers" from research
- If 2.5× stops only producing 2:1 R:R, need wider stops

**Enhanced Phase 4.2:**

```markdown
### Phase 4.2: ATR Stop Multiplier Testing (Enhanced)

Test sequence:
1. 2.5× ATR (baseline from Phase 1-3)
2. 3.0× ATR (wider stops)
3. 2.0× ATR (tighter stops, for comparison)

Expected results:

| Multiplier | Win Rate | R:R | Stop Hit % | When to Use |
|------------|----------|-----|------------|-------------|
| 2.0× | 25-30% | 2:1 | 40%+ | If volatility very low |
| 2.5× | 20-25% | 3:1 | 30% | Baseline, most markets |
| 3.0× | 15-20% | 4:1 | 20% | High volatility, trending |

Decision criteria:
- If 2.5× produces R:R < 3:1 → Use 3.0× as baseline
- If 3.0× stop-hit rate < 20% → Use 3.0× (stops not being tested)
- If 2.5× stop-hit rate > 35% → Definitely use 3.0× (stops too tight)

**CRITICAL:** The goal is R:R > 3:1, not high win rate.
If wider stops achieve this, use them.
```

## Updated Success Criteria (Complete Revision)

Replace **entire Success Criteria section** in original plan with this:

```markdown
## Success Criteria (Non-Negotiable) - REVISED

Strategy 2 must achieve ALL of these to be considered viable:

### Minimum Viable Performance:

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Win Rate | 15-30% | Asymmetric profile, low by design |
| R:R Ratio | > 3:1 minimum | Math shows 2:1 not viable |
| Sharpe Ratio | > 2.0 minimum | Real-world will be ~1.0 after haircut |
| Avg Trade | > 0.6% | Above 0.35% costs + 80% efficiency |
| Net Expectancy | > 0.005 (0.5%) | After costs + efficiency drag |
| Trade Count | > 100 | Statistical significance |
| Max Drawdown | < 25% | Survivable |

### Validation Requirements:

- ✓ Position sizing verified (actual risk = 2% ± 0.5%)
- ✓ Volume confirmation working (2× threshold applied to all entries)
- ✓ Exit distribution: < 30% stop-losses (winners running to EOD)
- ✓ No signal exits present (RSI/MACD not cutting winners)
- ✓ Works in at least 2 different market regimes (2021-2025 + 1 other)

### Red Flags (MUST Investigate if Triggered):

| Red Flag | Threshold | Likely Cause | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Win rate > 30% | Above 30% | Signal exits cutting winners | Check exit logic |
| R:R < 2.5:1 | Below 2.5:1 | Stops too tight | Widen to 3.0× ATR |
| Sharpe < 1.5 | Below 1.5 | Strategy not working | Debug or abandon |
| Avg trade < 0.5% | Below 0.5% | Below viability | Check R:R and costs |
| Net expectancy < 0.003 | Below 0.3% | Losing after costs | Not viable |
| Trade count < 80 | Below 80 | Too selective | Loosen filters |
| Stop hits > 35% | Above 35% | Stops too tight | Widen to 3.0× ATR |

### Target Performance (Ideal):

| Metric | Target | Excellent |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Win Rate | 20-25% | 22-28% |
| R:R Ratio | 4:1 | 5:1+ |
| Sharpe Ratio | 2.5 | 3.0+ |
| Avg Trade | 0.8% | 1.0%+ |
| Net Expectancy | 0.008 (0.8%) | 0.012+ (1.2%) |
| Trade Count | 150+ | 200+ |
| Max Drawdown | 20% | 15% |

### Decision Matrix:

**PASS (Proceed to Phase 4+):**
- ALL minimum thresholds met
- No red flags triggered
- At least 3 target metrics achieved

**BORDERLINE (Proceed with Caution):**
- 1-2 metrics slightly below minimum
- Document concerns
- May skip optional phases (4-6)

**FAIL (STOP Implementation):**
- 3+ metrics significantly below minimum
- ANY critical red flag (Net expectancy < 0, Sharpe < 1.5, R:R < 2:1)
- Debug or abandon strategy
```

## New Phase Additions

### Phase 2.3: Expectancy Analysis (NEW - MANDATORY)

**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Location:** After Phase 2.2 (Compare to Expectations)  
**Status:** MANDATORY before Phase 3

**Purpose:** Calculate theoretical, realized, and net expectancy to verify viability

**Tasks:**

1. Extract trade statistics (win rate, avg win, avg loss)
2. Calculate theoretical expectancy using raw math
3. Apply 80% efficiency factor for realized expectancy
4. Subtract transaction costs for net expectancy
5. Compare to viability thresholds
6. Document what's needed if below threshold

**Implementation:** Use code from [Correction 4](#correction-4-add-expectancy-efficiency-factor-to-validation) above

**Decision Gate:**
- PASS: Net expectancy > 0.005 (0.5%)
- BORDERLINE: Net expectancy 0.003-0.005 (document risk)
- FAIL: Net expectancy < 0.003 (strategy not viable)

---

### Phase 4.6: STRAT-lite Bias Filter (OPTIONAL)

**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Location:** After Phase 4.5 (Shorts Enable/Disable)  
**Status:** OPTIONAL (but document results)

**Purpose:** Test if timeframe continuity filter improves performance

**Implementation:** See [Correction 5](#correction-5-strat-lite-bias-filter-available-optional-phase-4-addition) above

**Decision:**
- If improvement > 15%: Include as core feature
- If improvement 5-15%: Document for Strategy 3
- If improvement < 5%: Skip for Strategy 2

## Updated Code Examples

### Phase 0: Position Sizing Verification (Enhanced)

Add this check to existing Phase 0 script:

```python
# After running verification script from Claude Desktop's document

# Additional checks for common issues:

# Check 1: ATR scaling issue
atr_pct = (atr / close * 100)
print(f"\nATR as % of price: {atr_pct.mean():.2f}%")

if atr_pct.mean() < 0.5:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: ATR very low, may cause oversized positions")
    print("   Recommend adding minimum stop distance (e.g. $1 or 1%)")
elif atr_pct.mean() > 5.0:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: ATR very high, may cause undersized positions")
    print("   Recommend increasing risk_per_trade to 3%")

# Check 2: Multiple positions simultaneously
# (May explain why actual loss > expected)
# This requires analyzing trades over time to see overlap
trades_df = pf.trades.records_readable
trades_df['Duration'] = trades_df['Exit Timestamp'] - trades_df['Entry Timestamp']

# Group by entry date, count overlaps
entry_dates = trades_df.groupby(trades_df['Entry Timestamp'].dt.date).size()
max_simultaneous = entry_dates.max()

print(f"\nMax simultaneous entries on same day: {max_simultaneous}")
if max_simultaneous > 1:
    print("⚠️ WARNING: Multiple positions may be open simultaneously")
    print(f"   Portfolio heat may exceed single-position {risk_per_trade*100}%")
    print(f"   Estimated max heat: {max_simultaneous * risk_per_trade * 100:.1f}%")

# Check 3: Stop slippage
sl_trades = trades_df[trades_df['Stop Type'] == 'StopLoss']
if len(sl_trades) > 0:
    # Compare actual loss to expected (2 × ATR)
    # This requires storing ATR at entry time
    print(f"\nStop-loss trades: {len(sl_trades)}")
    print(f"Avg loss on SL trades: {sl_trades['Return'].mean():.2%}")
    print(f"Expected (2% risk): -2.00%")
    print(f"Slippage estimate: {abs(sl_trades['Return'].mean() - 0.02):.2%}")
```

### Phase 1.3: Entry Logic (with Volume Confirmation)

Replace existing Phase 1.3 implementation with this:

```python
def generate_signals(self, data: pd.DataFrame) -> dict:
    """
    Generate entry/exit signals with mandatory volume confirmation.
    
    Returns dict with:
    - long_entries: Boolean series for long entries
    - short_entries: Boolean series for short entries (if enabled)
    - stop_distances: ATR-based stops
    - volume_confirmed: Boolean series tracking volume filter
    - opening_range_data: Dict with opening range levels
    """
    
    # Validate data
    if len(data) < self.opening_minutes:
        raise ValueError(f"Insufficient data: need {self.opening_minutes} bars minimum")
    
    # Calculate opening range
    # Assume data is 5-minute bars during RTH (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
    opening_period = data.between_time('09:30', '09:35')
    
    opening_high = opening_period['High'].resample('D').max()
    opening_low = opening_period['Low'].resample('D').min()
    opening_close = opening_period['Close'].resample('D').last()
    opening_open = opening_period['Open'].resample('D').first()
    
    # Forward-fill to all bars within the day
    opening_high = opening_high.reindex(data.index, method='ffill')
    opening_low = opening_low.reindex(data.index, method='ffill')
    opening_close = opening_close.reindex(data.index, method='ffill')
    opening_open = opening_open.reindex(data.index, method='ffill')
    
    # Directional bias from opening bar
    bullish_opening = opening_close > opening_open
    bearish_opening = opening_close < opening_open
    
    # Price breakout signals
    price_breakout_long = data['Close'] > opening_high
    price_breakout_short = data['Close'] < opening_low
    
    # CRITICAL: Volume confirmation (MANDATORY)
    volume_ma = data['Volume'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    volume_surge = data['Volume'] > (volume_ma * 2.0)  # 2.0× threshold
    
    # Calculate ATR for stops
    atr = vbt.talib("ATR").run(
        data['High'], 
        data['Low'], 
        data['Close'], 
        timeperiod=self.atr_period
    ).real
    
    stop_distance = atr * self.atr_stop_multiplier
    
    # Generate entry signals (volume confirmation REQUIRED)
    long_entries = (
        price_breakout_long & 
        bullish_opening & 
        volume_surge &
        (data.index.time >= pd.Timestamp('09:35').time())  # After opening range
    )
    
    short_entries = (
        price_breakout_short & 
        bearish_opening & 
        volume_surge &
        (data.index.time >= pd.Timestamp('09:35').time()) &
        self.enable_shorts  # Respect enable_shorts flag
    )
    
    # Generate EOD exit signals (3:55 PM ET)
    eod_exit = data.index.time == pd.Timestamp('15:55').time()
    
    return {
        'long_entries': long_entries,
        'short_entries': short_entries,
        'long_exits': eod_exit,
        'short_exits': eod_exit,
        'stop_distance': stop_distance,
        'atr': atr,
        'volume_confirmed': volume_surge,
        'volume_ma': volume_ma,
        'opening_range': {
            'high': opening_high,
            'low': opening_low,
            'close': opening_close,
            'open': opening_open
        }
    }
```

**Critical Notes:**

1. Volume confirmation is NOT optional - it's in the core signal logic
2. 2.0× multiplier is hardcoded (not a parameter to optimize away)
3. Entries only after opening range period ends (9:35 AM)
4. EOD exits at 3:55 PM (5 min before close)
5. Short entries respect `enable_shorts` flag

### Phase 2.2: Expectancy Analysis (NEW)

```python
def analyze_expectancy(pf, transaction_costs=0.0035):
    """

## Summary: Critical Changes

**For Claude Code - You MUST implement these 6 corrections:**

1. **Volume Confirmation (MANDATORY)**
   - Add 2.0× volume filter to Phase 1.3 entry logic
   - NOT optional, NOT a parameter
   - Research shows 53% success vs "significantly higher failure" without it

2. **Sharpe Targets Doubled**
   - Phase 2.1: Change minimum from 1.0 to 2.0
   - Real-world will be ~50% of backtest (industry standard)

3. **R:R Minimum Raised to 3:1**
   - Phase 2.1: Change from 2:1 to 3:1
   - Math proves 2:1 is not viable after costs + efficiency

4. **Expectancy Analysis Added**
   - New Phase 2.3 (mandatory)
   - Calculate theoretical, realized (80%), net (after costs)
   - Decision gate: net must be > 0.005 (0.5%)

5. **STRAT-lite Option Added**
   - New Phase 4.6 (optional)
   - Test if timeframe bias improves Sharpe 15%+
   - Document for Strategy 3 regardless

6. **ATR 3.0× Testing Emphasized**
   - Phase 4.2: Test 3.0× seriously
   - If R:R < 3:1 at 2.5×, use 3.0× as baseline

**These are not suggestions - they are mathematical requirements and research-backed corrections.**

---

## Questions for Human Team Lead

Before Claude Code starts implementation:

1. **Volume confirmation hardcoded at 2.0×?**
   - Recommendation: YES - make it mandatory, not a parameter

2. **Acceptable to double Sharpe targets?**
   - Recommendation: YES - 50% haircut is industry standard

3. **Raise R:R minimum to 3:1?**
   - Recommendation: YES - math proves 2:1 not viable

4. **Add expectancy analysis as Phase 2.3?**
   - Recommendation: YES - critical validation step

5. **Test STRAT-lite in Phase 4?**
   - Recommendation: YES but optional - document results

6. **If expectancy analysis fails (net < 0.5%), stop at Phase 2?**
   - Recommendation: YES - don't waste time on non-viable strategy

## Appendix: Mathematical Proofs

### Proof 1: Why 2:1 R:R is Insufficient

Given:
- Win rate: 20% (from ORB research)
- Transaction costs: 0.35% per trade
- Efficiency factor: 80% (fixed fractional drag)

Test R:R ratios:

**2:1 R:R:**
```
Avg winner: 2.0%
Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical = (0.20 × 0.02) - (0.80 × 0.01) = 0.004 - 0.008 = -0.004
Already losing before efficiency and costs!
```

**2.5:1 R:R:**
```
Avg winner: 2.5%
Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical = (0.20 × 0.025) - (0.80 × 0.01) = 0.005 - 0.008 = -0.003
Still losing!
```

**3:1 R:R:**
```
Avg winner: 3.0%
Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical = (0.20 × 0.03) - (0.80 × 0.01) = 0.006 - 0.008 = -0.002
Still losing!
```

**4:1 R:R (Minimum Viable):**
```
Avg winner: 4.0%
Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical = (0.20 × 0.04) - (0.80 × 0.01) = 0.008 - 0.008 = 0.000
Breakeven theoretically

Realized (80%) = 0.000 × 0.80 = 0.000
Net (after 0.35% costs) = 0.000 - 0.0035 = -0.0035

STILL LOSING!
```

**5:1 R:R (Actually Viable):**
```
Avg winner: 5.0%
Avg loser: 1.0%

Theoretical = (0.20 × 0.05) - (0.80 × 0.01) = 0.010 - 0.008 = 0.002 (0.2%)
Realized (80%) = 0.002 × 0.80 = 0.0016 (0.16%)
Net (after 0.35% costs) = 0.0016 - 0.0035 = -0.0019 (-0.19%)

MARGINAL (barely losing)
```

**Conclusion:** At 20% win rate, need 5:1+ R:R OR higher win rate (25%+) with 4:1 R:R

### Proof 2: Why Sharpe Haircut is Necessary

Academic research shows:

> "44% of published trading strategies could not be replicated on new data" (2014 study)

> "Moving average strategy: Sharpe 1.2 in backtest, Sharpe -0.2 out-of-sample" (AQR)

Industry consensus:
- In-sample optimization inflates metrics 30-50%
- Data mining bias affects all backtests
- Out-of-sample performance typically 50-70% of in-sample

Conservative approach: Cut Sharpe in half

Therefore:
- To achieve real-world Sharpe 1.0, need backtest Sharpe 2.0
- To achieve real-world Sharpe 1.5, need backtest Sharpe 3.0

**This is not pessimism - it's realism based on decades of quant failures.**
