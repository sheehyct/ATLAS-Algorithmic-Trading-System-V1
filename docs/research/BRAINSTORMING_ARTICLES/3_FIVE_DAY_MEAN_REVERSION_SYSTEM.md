Every few days, the market panics.

Weak hands dump, algos push lower, and Twitter screams ‚Äúcrash.‚Äù

But most of the time, it isn‚Äôt the start of a bear market‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just a flush.

**Our edge is simple:** buy the fear, sell the relief.

Today‚Äôs system does exactly that, using clear rules and sizing that adapts to volatility.

**Simple to run. Built to last.**

## The Problem‚Ä¶

-   **Overtrading noise.** Traders chase every wiggle and get chopped before the real move.
-   **Sizing without context.** Fixed-size entries ignore changing volatility and turn a routine dip into a portfolio event.
-   **No exit discipline.** Profits from quick bounces evaporate because there‚Äôs no objective ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough‚Äù signal.

Without a repeatable edge and rules-based sizing, equity curves become biographies of mood swings.

## Strategy Overview

Our strategy, the ‚Äú5-Day Mean Reversion System,‚Äù is built on a simple premise: markets, especially the big indices, tend to revert to their mean after extreme moves.

We‚Äôre not trying to catch every swing, we‚Äôre targeting specific, short-term oversold conditions in the Nasdaq and S&P 500.

Here‚Äôs the essence in 3 key points:

1.  **The Entry Trigger (The Dip):** We look for a clear, decisive dip. Specifically, we enter when we have seen a 5-day washout (a close after a quick cascade of lower lows). This acts as our signal that the market has experienced a significant, short-term downward impulse, creating an oversold opportunity.
2.  **Long Only:** We are only interested in capturing upward rebounds. This simplifies the strategy, aligning with the general long-term upward bias of these major indices.
3.  **The Exit Condition (The Rebound or Time Limit):** We exit when the market shows signs of recovery. This tells us that momentum has shifted back to the upside. However, to prevent being stuck in a prolonged losing trade, we also have a hard time stop.

The beauty of this system lies in its clear, objective rules. No guesswork, no subjective interpretations, just a direct response to specific market behavior.

## Backtest Setup

-   **Markets:** Nasdaq 100 Futures (US Tech 100).
-   **Timeframe:** Daily bars.
-   **Sample window:** _2000‚Äì2025_ (covers multiple regimes: dot-com, GFC, 2020 crash, 2022 bear).
-   **Costs:** A spread cost of 1 point included.
-   **Money management:** Volatility-scaled position size.

## Why It Works

-   **Behavioral edge:** Short-term selloffs are often **liquidity events**, not new fundamentals. Participants puke into weakness and the reflex bounce comes from mean-reversion of flows and re-risking once the immediate pressure is gone.
-   **Behavioral Edge:** The strategy profits from the predictable irrationality of other market participants. When fear drives prices down too quickly, our system steps in, anticipating the inevitable snap-back when cooler heads (or simply algorithmic buying) return.
-   **Short-Term Horizon:** By focusing on quick rebounds and having a time-based exit, we avoid getting entangled in longer-term trends or corrections that could erode profits. We‚Äôre in and out, capturing the immediate opportunity.

## Takeaways & Next Steps

Here are the key lessons from the 5-Day Mean Reversion System:

1.  **Simplicity is King:** Complex systems often hide underlying flaws. A clear, understandable edge is easier to implement and trust.
2.  **Patience Pays:** Waiting for specific, low-risk conditions prevents overtrading and improves trade quality.
3.  **Know Your Exit:** A clear exit strategy, both based on profit-taking and loss control is crucial for managing risk and maximizing returns.
4.  **Embrace Mean Reversion:** Identifying and capitalizing on temporary extremes is a powerful strategy, especially in highly liquid instruments.
5.  You can begin to test this concept yourself by observing how Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures react after significant, multi-day drops. Look for the subsequent rebound and assess its strength.
