# Documentation Restoration Summary

## Session Date
October 18, 2025

## Restoration Type
CRITICAL - Documentation contamination from old STRAT project

---

## Problem Discovered

### CLAUDE.md Contamination (53% Invalid Content)

**File:** `docs/CLAUDE.md`
**Lines affected:** 135-286 (151 lines of 285 total)
**Severity:** CRITICAL

**What was wrong:**
The repository's CLAUDE.md contained 151 lines (53%) of content from the OLD STRAT PROJECT dated "October 1, 2025":

```
Line 135: ## CURRENT STATE - October 1, 2025

Lines 136-168: WORKING Components (OLD STRAT PROJECT)
  - Bar Classification with Governing Range (core/analyzer.py)
  - Pattern Detection (2-1-2, 3-1-2, etc.)
  - TFC Continuity Scoring (tests/test_basic_tfc.py)
  - Multi-Timeframe Data Manager (data/mtf_manager.py)

Lines 169-188: File Structure (STRAT PROJECT)
  core/analyzer.py     # STRATAnalyzer
  core/components.py   # PivotDetector, InsideBarTracker
  core/triggers.py     # Intrabar trigger detection

  NONE OF THESE FILES EXIST in ATLAS!

Lines 189-238: Session Start Checklist, What Was Fixed Today (Oct 1)
  - All STRAT-specific (Saturday bar bug, 2-2 reversal exits, TFC implementation)
```

**Impact:**
- Developers would reference non-existent files (core/analyzer.py, etc.)
- Documentation claimed STRAT features were "working" that don't exist
- Mixed ATLAS and STRAT content created confusion
- Git history showed STRAT content dated AFTER ATLAS migration (impossible)

### HANDOFF.md Minor Issues

**File:** `docs/HANDOFF.md`
**Lines affected:** 367-372, 612
**Severity:** MEDIUM

**What was wrong:**

**Issue 1: Incorrect File Structure (lines 367-372)**
```
├── core/               # STRAT logic (keep as-is)
│   ├── analyzer.py     # Bar classification (working)
│   ├── components.py   # Pattern detectors (working)
│   └── triggers.py     # Intrabar detection (working)
```

**Reality:** `core/` directory is empty (just `__init__.py`)

**Issue 2: Volume Threshold Mismatch (line 612)**
- Document stated: "1.5x average volume threshold"
- Should be: "2.0x average volume threshold" (per STRATEGY_2_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDENDUM.md)

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### How did STRAT content get into ATLAS CLAUDE.md?

**Hypothesis:** During git merge from experimental to main branch:
1. CLAUDE.md had merge conflict
2. Conflict resolution incorrectly merged OLD STRAT content (Oct 1) with NEW ATLAS content
3. Lines 1-134 (ATLAS professional standards) were kept
4. Lines 135-286 (STRAT project state from Oct 1) were accidentally merged in
5. No verification was done post-merge

**Evidence:**
- Commit 4be3ef4 "refactor: remove STRAT-related files" removed STRAT code
- Commit 63df959 "refactor: remove additional documentation files" cleaned more
- But CLAUDE.md lines 135-286 survived the cleanup (hidden in middle of file)

**Git history:**
```
63df959 refactor: remove additional documentation files
82210e7 docs: add Phase 2 foundation implementation startup prompt
16ede28 refactor: remove STRAT_Knowledge documentation directory
4be3ef4 refactor: remove STRAT-related files and documentation
```

STRAT removal commits happened, but CLAUDE.md wasn't fully cleaned.

## Solution Implemented

### CLAUDE.md Complete Restoration (599 lines)

**Source Strategy:**
1. **Lines 1-134 from current repo** - Professional standards, VBT doc system, NYSE hours (KEEP)
2. **Lines 73-226 from recovered** - 5-step VBT verification workflow (ADD - was missing)
3. **Lines 291-324 from recovered** - Volume confirmation gate (ADD - was missing, UPDATE 1.5x→2.0x)
4. **NEW SECTION created** - OpenAI_VBT Integration (references to guides created Oct 18)
5. **Lines 249-285 from current repo** - Context management, security, DO NOT list (KEEP)
6. **Lines 391-418 from recovered** - Summary: Critical Workflows (ADD - was missing)
7. **Lines 135-248 from current repo** - DELETED (STRAT contamination removed)

**New Content Added:**
- **5-Step VBT Verification Workflow** (154 lines)
  - STEP 1: SEARCH (use mcp__vectorbt-pro__search)
  - STEP 2: VERIFY API (resolve_refnames, get_attrs)
  - STEP 3: FIND EXAMPLES (mcp__vectorbt-pro__find)
  - STEP 4: TEST MINIMAL EXAMPLE (mcp__vectorbt-pro__run_code)
  - STEP 5: IMPLEMENT (only after 1-4 pass)
  - ENFORCEMENT section (zero tolerance for skipping)
  - When to consult QuantGPT
  - Example workflows (correct vs incorrect)

- **Volume Confirmation Gate** (60 lines)
  - MANDATORY for all breakout strategies
  - 2.0x threshold (updated from recovered 1.5x)
  - Implementation pattern with code
  - Verification checklist
  - Rejection criteria

- **OpenAI_VBT Integration Section** (50 lines)
  - References to RESOURCE_UTILIZATION_GUIDE.md
  - References to PRACTICAL_DEVELOPMENT_EXAMPLES.md
  - References to DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES_OVERVIEW.md
  - Workflow integration example
  - Decision tree for tool selection

- **Summary: Critical Workflows** (35 lines)
  - Every Session checklist
  - Every VBT Implementation checklist
  - Every Claim checklist
  - Zero tolerance items

**Final CLAUDE.md:**
- 599 lines (vs 285 contaminated lines)
- 100% ATLAS content
- 0 STRAT references
- All VBT workflows documented
- Professional ASCII-only formatting

### HANDOFF.md Corrections

**Changes Made:**

**1. File Structure Section (lines 365-408) - REPLACED**

**Before:**
```
├── core/               # STRAT logic (keep as-is)
│   ├── analyzer.py     # Bar classification (working)
│   ├── components.py   # Pattern detectors (working)
│   └── triggers.py     # Intrabar detection (working)
├── data/               # Data management (keep as-is)
│   ├── alpaca.py       # Alpaca fetching (working)
│   └── mtf_manager.py  # Multi-timeframe manager (working)
├── tests/              # Existing tests (keep)
│   ├── test_strat_vbt_alpaca.py
│   ├── test_basic_tfc.py
│   ├── test_strat_components.py
│   └── test_gate1_position_sizing.py
```

**After:**
```
├── core/               # Empty placeholder (STRAT files removed)
│   └── __init__.py
├── data/               # Data fetching utilities
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── alpaca.py       # Alpaca data fetching (working)
│   └── mtf_manager.py  # Multi-timeframe data manager (working)
├── tests/              # Test suite
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_gate1_position_sizing.py  # Gate 1 tests (PASSING)
├── docs/               # Reorganized documentation
│   ├── CLAUDE.md           # Development rules (UPDATED Oct 18 - STRAT removed)
│   ├── OpenAI_VBT/         # VBT development guides (NEW - Session 4)
│   │   ├── DEVELOPMENT_GUIDES_OVERVIEW.md
│   │   ├── PRACTICAL_DEVELOPMENT_EXAMPLES.md
│   │   └── RESOURCE_UTILIZATION_GUIDE.md
```

**2. Volume Threshold (line 612) - CORRECTED**

**Before:** "1.5x average volume threshold"
**After:** "2.0x average volume threshold"

**Rationale:** STRATEGY_2_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDENDUM.md line 73-74 specifies 2.0x

```

**Status:** HANDOFF.md CLEAN - All inaccuracies corrected

---

## Prevention Strategy

### How to Prevent Future Documentation Contamination

#### 1. Git Merge Hygiene

**BEFORE merging any branch:**
```bash
# Check what will be merged
git diff main..branch-name docs/CLAUDE.md
git diff main..branch-name docs/HANDOFF.md

# Look for suspicious patterns:
# - Old dates (earlier than current date)
# - References to removed files
# - Different project names (STRAT vs ATLAS)
```

**DURING merge conflicts:**
```bash
# When resolving conflicts in documentation:
# 1. Read BOTH versions completely
# 2. Verify referenced files exist
# 3. Check dates make sense
# 4. Search for project-specific keywords

# Example check:
grep -i "strat\|tfc\|analyzer.py" docs/CLAUDE.md
# Should return 0 hits (or only contextual references)
```

**AFTER merge:**
```bash
# Verification checklist:
# 1. Read docs/CLAUDE.md end-to-end
# 2. Read docs/HANDOFF.md end-to-end
# 3. Verify file structure section matches: ls -la
# 4. Check dates are current
# 5. Search for old project keywords
```

#### 2. Documentation Review Protocol

**Every commit to docs/ must:**
1. State what changed and why in commit message
2. Include verification that referenced files exist
3. Update "Last Updated" timestamp
4. Update version number if major changes

**Example good commit:**
```
docs: update CLAUDE.md with 5-step VBT verification workflow

Added missing 5-step VBT workflow from recovered documentation.
Updated volume confirmation threshold from 1.5x to 2.0x per
STRATEGY_2_IMPLEMENTATION_ADDENDUM.md requirements.

Verified: All referenced files exist in current repo structure.
Verified: No STRAT references remain (grep returned 0 hits).

Last Updated: 2025-10-18
Version: 2.0
```

#### 3. Session Handoff Protocol

**At END of every session:**
1. Update HANDOFF.md with session summary
2. Include timestamp and date
3. List files modified
4. List next actions
5. Run documentation verification script (if created)

**At START of every session:**
1. Read HANDOFF.md completely (mandatory)
2. Verify current branch
3. Verify date makes sense
4. Check if file structure section needs updates

#### 4. File Structure Validation

**Create validation script:** `scripts/validate_docs.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Documentation validation script

echo "Validating documentation accuracy..."

# Check STRAT contamination
if grep -q "STRATAnalyzer\|core/analyzer.py\|test_strat_" docs/CLAUDE.md; then
    echo "ERROR: STRAT contamination detected in CLAUDE.md"
    exit 1
fi

# Check file structure section matches reality
if grep -q "core/analyzer.py" docs/HANDOFF.md; then
    echo "ERROR: HANDOFF.md references non-existent core/analyzer.py"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify referenced files exist
while IFS= read -r file; do
    if [ ! -f "$file" ] && [ ! -d "$file" ]; then
        echo "WARNING: Referenced file doesn't exist: $file"
    fi
done < <(grep -oP "(?<=\├── )[a-zA-Z0-9_./]+" docs/HANDOFF.md | grep -v "^#")

echo "Validation complete."
```

**Run on every commit:**
```bash
# Add to pre-commit hook
.git/hooks/pre-commit:
#!/bin/bash
bash scripts/validate_docs.sh || exit 1
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Documentation is Code

**Lesson:** Treat documentation with same rigor as code.

**Actions:**
- Version documentation (Last Updated, Version number)
- Review documentation in PRs
- Run validation scripts on commit
- Never skip documentation updates

### 2. Merge Conflicts are Dangerous

**Lesson:** Git merge can silently introduce contamination.

**Actions:**
- Always review full file after conflict resolution
- Check dates and project names
- Verify referenced files exist
- When in doubt, regenerate from scratch

### 3. Session Handoffs Need Structure

**Lesson:** Unstructured handoffs lead to lost context.

**Actions:**
- Template for HANDOFF.md updates
- Mandatory sections: Summary, Next Actions, Blockers
- Timestamp every session
- Cross-reference commits

### 4. Prevention > Detection

**Lesson:** Catching contamination early prevents wasted work.

**Actions:**
- Validation scripts in CI/CD
- Pre-commit hooks for documentation
- Mandatory review of docs/ changes
- Automated testing of file references

# Read corrected HANDOFF.md (entire file)
cat docs/HANDOFF.md

# Verify VBT accessible
uv run python -c "import vectorbtpro as vbt; print(f'VBT Pro {vbt.__version__} loaded')"
```

2. **Follow documented workflows:**
- Use 5-step VBT verification for ANY VBT feature
