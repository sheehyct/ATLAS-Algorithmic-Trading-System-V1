# ATLAS - Adaptive Trading with Layered Asset System

A quantitative trading system implementing regime-aware portfolio management with academically validated statistical methods.

## Overview

ATLAS is a multi-strategy algorithmic trading platform that adapts strategy allocation based on detected market regimes. The system implements regime detection using peer-reviewed statistical methods with demonstrated 33-year empirical validation, combined with professional risk management and position sizing controls.

## Core Approach

**Regime-Aware Allocation**: The system detects market regimes (bull, bear, neutral, crash) using statistical change-point detection and adjusts strategy exposure accordingly. During high-volatility regimes, defensive strategies receive higher allocation; during trending markets, momentum strategies dominate.

**Academic Foundation**: Regime detection implements the statistical jump model from Shu et al. (Princeton University, 2024), which demonstrated:
- Sharpe ratio improvements of 20-42% over buy-and-hold across S&P 500, DAX, and Nikkei
- Maximum drawdown reductions of approximately 50%
- Volatility reductions of approximately 30%
- 33 years of empirical validation (1990-2023)

**Multi-Strategy Portfolio**: Five uncorrelated strategies provide diversification across different market conditions:
- Opening Range Breakout (momentum/volatility)
- Regime-Aware Mean Reversion (oscillating markets)
- Pairs Trading (market-neutral statistical arbitrage)
- Semi-Volatility Momentum (trending markets)

## Project Status

**Current Phase**: Regime detection implementation (Phase C of 6-phase plan)

**Completed Components**:
- Position sizing with ATR-based stops and capital constraints
- Opening Range Breakout strategy with volume confirmation
- Feature calculation for regime detection (downside deviation, Sortino ratios)
- Optimization solver using dynamic programming and coordinate descent
- Cross-validation framework for parameter selection
- Portfolio heat management and risk controls

**Test Coverage**: 115 of 121 tests passing (95%)

**Validation Targets**:
- March 2020 crash detection: >50% accuracy (vs 4.2% baseline)
- Annual regime switches: 0.5-1.0 (prevents over-trading)
- Out-of-sample Sharpe improvement: +20% to +42%

**Implementation Progress**:
- Phase A (Feature Calculation): Complete
- Phase B (Optimization Solver): Complete
- Phase C (Parameter Selection): Complete
- Phase D (Online Inference): Pending
- Phase E (Regime Mapping): Pending
- Phase F (Final Validation): Pending

## Architecture

### Regime Detection

The statistical jump model uses a two-state Gaussian process with temporal penalty to identify market regimes:

**Features**:
- Downside Deviation (10-day exponential weighted moving average)
- Sortino Ratio (20-day and 60-day halflife)

**Optimization**:
- Dynamic programming solver (O(T*K^2) complexity)
- Coordinate descent with multi-start initialization
- Temporal penalty parameter controls regime persistence
- Cross-validation using 8-year rolling window

**Output**: Binary classification (bull/bear) mapped to four-regime system (bull, neutral, bear, crash)

### Risk Management

**Position Sizing**:
- ATR-based stop losses (2.5x multiplier)
- Capital constraints (never exceed available capital)
- Volatility normalization across instruments

**Portfolio Heat**:
- Total exposure limit: 6-8% of portfolio value
- Aggregate risk across all open positions
- Automatic signal rejection when at exposure limit

**Circuit Breakers**:
- Maximum drawdown limits
- Daily loss limits
- Regime-based exposure adjustments

### Strategy Framework

All strategies inherit from `BaseStrategy` abstract class:
- `generate_signals()`: Entry/exit signal generation
- `calculate_position_size()`: Risk-based position sizing
- `validate_parameters()`: Parameter validation
- `get_performance_metrics()`: Performance calculation
